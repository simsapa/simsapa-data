Acchaka

Sloth Bear, also called *[ikka](/define/ikka)*, *Melursus ursinus* Ja.vi.538. This medium\-sized bear has a shaggy black coat, a white v\-shaped mark on its breast and a long white snout. It has a slow lumbering gait but can attack swiftly and without provocation. Sloth bears sometimes attacked forest\-dwelling monks A.iii.100. Monks were allowed to have a bear skin mat Vin.ii.174 and to use bear fat as a medicine Vin.i.200. Sloth bears have black hair and one cannot escape them even by climbing a tree Ja.vi.507. One Jātaka story describes villagers finding a bear near their village and attacking it with arrows, sticks and staffs to drive it away Ja.iv.327.

This slender straight tree has bright green leaves, snow\-white flowers and can grow up to 20 meters high. The resinous wood is prized for its fragrant smell and the oil extracted from it is widely used in traditional medicine. As with sandalwood, aloes was ground into a paste on a stone and then rubbed on the limbs as a perfume Ja.iv.440 Mil.388. The gods are described as being “draped in garments of red and gold and fragrant with aloes, *[piyaṅgu](/define/piyaṅgu)* and sandalwood” Vv.53.7.

Agārasappa

Common Wolf Snake, *Lycodon aulicus*. The Pāḷi name means “house snake”. The color and markings of this snake are variable but it is usually light to dark\-brown with yellow crossbars and it can grow up to 765 mm. Of all Indian snakes this is the one most commonly found in human habitation, whether in rural areas or crowded cities. It hides during the day and comes out at night to hunt geckos, skinks, mice, cockroaches and birds nesting in roofs. Although non\-venomous, the wolf snake closely resembles the very dangerous krait and is often mistaken for it. Its its discovery in a house usually causes consternation. The Jātaka describes a man carrying an unlucky robe on a stick “as if he were carrying a house snake” Ja.i.372.

Goats are medium\-sized mammals related to sheep with backward\-sloping horns and short tails. They were kept for their milk, meat and wool. We read of goats being slaughtered at sacrifices, of long\-haired goat getting caught in thorn bushes Ja.426 Ja.437 S.ii.228 and of a man keeping goats, living on the milk and making smoke to protect them from mosquitoes Ja.iii.401. Saddles were sometimes tipped with goats” horns Vin.i.196. There is an unusual Jātaka story in which an abandoned child is suckled by a goat Ja.v.429.

Amba

Mango, Hindi *am*, *Mangifera indica*, a large evergreen tree of which there are about 700 varieties in India and which is cultivated mainly for its delicious fruit. The fruit can be nearly round but are more commonly elongated and turned up slightly at the end and are golden\-yellow color when ripe. The fruit was eaten with relish and it was also made into a drink Ja.281 Vin.i.245. Mango peel was put in curries Vin.ii.109. The color of monks” and nuns” robes were compared to that of the mango Th.197. Groves of mango trees were, and indeed still are, found outside most villages in India. People planted such groves to provide fruit and to picnic in during the spring and wandering ascetics often used to reside in them. The monk Meghiya described one such grove thus: “Truly lovely and delightful is this mango grove; a good place for one wanting to meditate”Ud.34. Several mango groves are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka; Pāvārika’s Mango Grove at Nālandā, Cunda’s Mango Grove at Pāvā, the Grove of wild mangoes at Macchikāsaṇḍa and Jīvaka’s Mango Grove which was outside the east gate of Rājagaha A.v.263 D.i.47 S.iv.281.

One who wants mangoes will knock them out of the tree by throwing a mango at them Mil.189. The famous trick where a mango seed is made to apparently sprout, grow leaves, flower and then bear fruit, all within a few minutes, was already being performed by conjurers during the Buddha’s time Ja.iv.324. The previous Buddha Sikhī was enlightened under a white mango tree D.ii.4.

Ambakamaddarī

Eurasian Golden Oriole, *Oriolus oriolus*, a thrush\-sized bird, golden yellow with black wings and tail and a black streak through the eye. The bird’s Pāḷi name is probably due to both its ripe\-mango color and the fact that it arrives in northern India in Spring just as the mangoes ripen, although in some areas it is resident. The Eurasian golden oriole is arboreal and feeds on fruits, berries and nectar. The Buddha mentioned that its harsh screeching call is not as impressive as that of as that of the the domestic fowl A.i.187.

Assa

Horse, also called *haya* and *turaga*, *Equus caballus*. The horse is a large herbivorous mammal adapted for running and which has been domesticated for at least 5000 years. A thoroughbred was called *assājāniya* A.i.77 M.i.124, a nag *assakhaluṅka* A.i.287, a mare *vaḷavā* M.ii.153 and a foal *assapotaka* Ja.ii.288. The finest horses were imported into northern India from Sindh Dhp.322 and were called *bhojjha* Ja.i.180 or *sindhava* Ja.i.175 Ja.ii.96 Ja.iii.287. The Kathiawari, India’s indigenous horse, was probably derived from the cross\-breeding of Sindh and Arab horses in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Horses were too expensive to be used for ordinary transport and were reserved mainly for royalty,for chariots and for cavalry during war. Chariots and cavalry were two of the four branches of the army. The importance of horses in ancient India is suggested by the space given to their care, maintenance and training in the *Arthaśāstra*.

A horse fit for a king was expected to have five qualities; to have a good stud line, when given food, whether green or dried, it should eat it carefully and not scatter it about, it will not lay in its own dung, it should not fight with the other horses, it should show itself as it is to its trainer, and it should pull the carriage properly A.iv.188. Horses were trained using gentle means, harsh means and a combination of both A.ii.110. This is similar of the *Aśvaṣāstra’s* advice that a combination of gentleness, rewards and punishment is the best way of training horses. Horses were trained in special grounds and were penned either in stables or in circular corrals and fed steamed rice Vin.iii.5. We read of the best three\-year\-old rice fed to a king’s Sindh horse Ja.i.178. A good horse would respond even to the shadow of the whip A.ii.113 and a thoroughbred was expected to be endowed with beauty, stamina, speed A.i.243 and be finely proportioned A.i.288. A highly\-strung horse would not move when urged on, upset the carriage, kick up its hind legs and break the shafts, rear up in the air and pull at the bit A.iv.190. Ropes and cords were made out of horsehair A.iv.129 S.ii.238 as were sieves M.i.229, brushes A.i.209 and bird snares Ja.v.362 and couches were stuffed with it Vin.ii.170. Being able to judge a good horse was a respected skill and horsemanship was an art taught to princes A.iii.152 A.iii.326. The Vedic horse sacrifice (*assamedha*) was still being performed by kings A.ii.42 S.i.76 and fights between stallions were arranged for entertainment D.i.7. Horses” tails were sometimes platted D.i.105. The Tipiṭaka mentions the castration of animals and men who preformed this job, although there is no specific mention of this being done to stallions Ja.iv.364 M.i.383. The Buddha urged his disciples to be like a good horse. “Like a well\-bred horse touched by the whip, be eager and swift” Dhp.144. King Asoka’s 5<sup>th</sup>Pillar Edict mentions that branding horses and cattle was banned on certain full\-moon days. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a Sindh horse Ja.i.178.

Mules were used as pack animals and to draw carts and chariots S.i.211. The best mules were bred in Kamboja in north\-west India Ja.vi.342. The ancient Indians knew that mules were sterile M.ii.153. The Buddha once said: “Well trained mules are excellent as are thoroughbred Sindh horses and noble tusked elephants; but better still is he who has trained himself”Dhp.322.

Assattha

Bodhi Tree, Hindi *pipal*, *Ficus religiosa*. This variety of fig has large spreading boughs and leaves ending in a characteristic pointed tip. The *assattha* is semi\-parasitic, sometimes growing up against other trees and stunting them S.v.96. It can also grow on the walls of buildings causing them great damage. The small fruit of the tree was called *pipphala* Ja.vi.518. Like other figs, it grows from a tiny seed into a huge tree S.v.96. It was said that a woman’s heart beats on seeing her son “as the tender leaves of the *assattha* tremble in the breeze” Ja.v.328.

The *assattha* was considered sacred in India centuries before the Buddha and is represented in seals from Mohenjodaro dating from before 1000 BCE. The Buddha stated that he had attained enlightenment at the foot of an *assattha* tree D.ii.4 and the actual one he was sitting under at the time was sometimes called “The Tree of Knowledge” (*Jñānadruma*, Bc.13.65). This tree is referred to in the four Nikāyas as “The Tree of Awakening” (*Bodhirukkha*) although it is only mentioned twice (D.ii.4 Ud.1 repeated at Vin.i.1) in the earliest part of the Tipiṭaka.

Before the Buddha’s enlightenment, the area around the Bodhi Tree was covered with silvery sand without a blade of grass growing on it and all the surrounding trees and flowering shrubs were bending as if in homage towards it Ja.iv.233. According to the Nidānakathā, the Buddha spent his second week at Uruvelā (i.e. Bodh Gaya) gazing at the Bodhi Tree out of gratitude for the shelter it had offered him Ja.i.77. The same text says that as the Buddha sat meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, *aṅkura* the colour of red coral sprinkled down on him as if they were an offering Ja.i.75. *Aṅkura* usually means a shoot but here it must refer to the glossy crimson sheathing stipuls that are cast off as the new leaves of Bodhi trees develop.

In the early centuries of Buddhism, the *assattha* tree became a symbol of the Buddha and in the sculptures of both Bharhut and Sanchi he is depicted as such. In the *Mahāvastu*, he is actually given the epitaph “Great Tree” (*Mahādruma*, Mv.ii.280). A branch of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka by the nun Saṅghamittā, the daughter of King Asoka, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE and is believed to still grow in Anurādhapura. A distant ancestor of the original Bodhi Tree grows behind the Mahābodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya.

Bhamara

Rock Bee, *Apis dorsata*, a large aggressive wild bee with a shiny black body and which builds huge nests on cliffs and the branches of tall trees. It is one of several native Indian bees which produce honey collected for human consumption Ja.v.205. The Buddha said that a monk depending on a village for alms should be like a rock bee which collects honey from the flower without damaging its color or fragrance Dhp.49. He also said that a lay person should accumulate wealth the way a rock bee gathers pollen, i.e. diligently D.iii.188. Glossy black hair was often compared to the color of the rock bee Thi.252 as was an arahat’s clay bowl Ja.iv.114. One of the strings of the Indian lute was called the *bhamaratanti* because it sounded similar to the deep resonant humming of this bee Ja.ii.253. The Nidānakathā mentions a swarm of “five\-colored *bhamaras*” Ja.i.52. The *Carakasaṃhitā* mentions *bhamara* as one of the eight types of honey.

Domestic Cat, also called *[babbu](/define/babbu)*, *babbuka*, or *[majjara](/define/majjara)*, Hindi *billi*, *Felis sylvestris* D.ii.83 Ja.i.480 Vin.i.186. Cats are small mammals of the family Felidae with rounded heads, erect ears and large eyes with vertical\-slit pupils. They also have sharp claws that can be retracted into sheaths. The ancient Indians did not keep cats as pets but only to kill rats and mice and other household pests. The Buddha commented that a cat will sit at a door post, a rubbish heap or a drain patiently waiting for mice M.i.335. Nāgasena said: “As a cat in caves and holes and inside large houses, seeks only after rats, so too the meditator, the earnest student of meditation, in the village, the forest, at the root of a tree or an empty place should constantly, continually and with diligence seek only the nourishment of mindfulness of the body”Mil.ii.393.

There are several species of wild cats in northern India, the Leopard Cat (*Felis bengalensis*), the Fishing Cat (*Felis viverrina*) and the Jungle Cat (*Felis chaus*) being the main ones. The mention of cats in the jungle and of the hunting of cats probably refers to these animals rather than their domestic cousins. The cat skin bags the Buddha spoke of were probably made out of the beautifully marked pelts of wild cats such as the leopard cat M.i.128.

Bīja

Seed. A seed is a new plant in the form of an embryo. Some of the parts of seeds mentioned in the Tipiṭaka include the husk (*thusa*), the kernel (*miñja*), and in the case of germinating seeds, the sprout or shoot (*aṅkura*). The seeds of certain plants are encased in a pod (*sipāṭaka* or *kuṭṭhilika*). In order to germinate a seed has to have an intact casing, be fresh, be unspoiled by wind or heat and be sown in a good field with properly prepared soil A.i.135. Some seeds have hard shells that crack only if burned and it was noticed that new shoots often appear quickly after a forest fire S.i.69. The two factors that enable a seed to grow are nutrition from the soil (*paṭhavi rasa*) and moisture S.i.134. Whether the leaves or fruit of the plant is sweet or bitter was believed to depend not on the nutrition but on the nature of the seed A.i.32. Commenting on the endless cycle of agriculture the monk Kāḷudāyin said: “Again and again they sow the seed; again and again the god king rains; again and again farmers plough the fields; again and yet again the country has grain” Th.532. The seven types of edible seeds usually mentioned in the Tipiṭaka are *[sāli](/define/sāli)*, *[vīhi](/define/vīhi)*, *[mugga](/define/mugga)*, *[māsa](/define/māsa)*, *[tila](/define/tila)* and *[taṇḍula](/define/taṇḍula)* M.i.457. Elsewhere, the first two of these are included in a list of edible grains Vin.iv.264. See [Dhañña](/define/Dhañña).

Bīraṇa

*Andropogon muricatus* Ja.vi.508 S.iii.137, a common stout tufted grass usually found growing in damp or swampy ground. When dried the root of this grass, called *[usīra](/define/usīra)* in Pāḷi, gives off a pleasant fragrance. The Buddha mentioned the fine fibers of the *[usīra](/define/usīra)* root A.i.204 and recommended the root itself as a medicine Vin.i.201. It was also used to rub down elephants Ja.v.39 and corpses were sometimes laid out on a bed of *bīraṇa* grass D.iii.7. The *Mahāvastu* describes a maiden as having a complexion like *[usīra](/define/usīra)*, probably referring to the fresh root’s delicate pink color Mv.ii.59. The Buddha said: “This I say to you, sirs, who are gathered here; dig up the root of craving as one seeking the *[usīra](/define/usīra)* digs up *bīraṇa* grass” Dhp.337.

Cakkavāka

Brahminy Shelduck, Hindi *chakwa*, *Tadorna ferruginea* Ja.iii.520 Ja.vi.189, a large orange\-brown duck, its head being slightly lighter in color and with black wing tips and tail. Shelducks are often seen in pairs or small flocks on river banks where they eat vegetation, mollusks, insects and fish. The Jātaka describes the shelduck as reddish in color, rounded in body and feeding off moss and green leaves Ja.iv.70. The compound *cakravāka* occurs in the *»g Veda* and mean something like “circle of sound”. Shelducks were probably given this name because pairs keep in touch at night by calling to each other. In later Indian literature the bird came to be associated with numerous virtues but especially with marital fidelity, although this gets no mention in the Tipiṭaka. However, the *Milindapañha* says: “As a shelduck never forsakes his mate as long as life lasts, even so, a meditator, an earnest student of meditation must not forsake clear comprehension for as lomg as life lasts” Mil.401.

Candana

Sandalwood. Both the Pāḷi and the English words are used loosely for a group of related trees that produce fragrant wood and oil. *Candana* refers primarily to *Santalum album* Dhp.54, a small\-sized evergreen tree with a small pale flower gradually becoming crimson. The heartwood of this tree, called *haricandana*, ranges in color from whitish to yellowish and is strongly scented. The heartwood of the roots is even more so J.i.146 Vv.83.1. The Tipiṭaka also refers to Red Sandalwood, (*lohita candana* or *rattacandana*), *Pterocarpus santainus* A.iii.237 A.v..22 Ja.iv.442. Both red and white sandalwood grow in the Deccan and South India and must have been imported into the north.

Sandalwood had many uses. It was pulverized and smeared on the body as a perfume and for its supposed cooling properties Thi.145 Thi.267. The paste was made by grinding a piece of wood on a stone Ja.iv.440. Being soft, fine\-grained and easy to carve it was made into luxury objects A.i.9. We read that a wealthy merchant had a bowl carved out of sandalwood. He even kept the off\-cuts to use for other purposes Vin.i.109. The Buddha said that when he was a prince he used only sandalwood from Vārānasi A.i.145. Powered sandalwood (*candanacuṇṇa*) was sometimes rubbed dry on the body or burned as an incense, and it is said that sandalwood powder fell from the sky just before the Buddha’s final Nirvāna at Kusinārā D.ii.137.

The early Buddhists frequently equated sandalwood with things thought of as virtuous or holy. “Just as a man who came across a piece of yellow or red sandalwood and he smelled it at the root, in the middle or at the top he would experience a beautiful, sweet and pleasant fragrance, even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts one experiences elation and joy” A.iii.237. The *Milindapañha* compared Nirvāna to the precious and rare red sandalwood. “As red sandalwood is hard to obtain, even so, Nirvāna is hard to obtain. Again, red sandalwood is unequalled for its lovely fragrance,even so is Nirvāna unequalled for its lovely fragrance.Yet again, red sandalwood is praised by good people; even so is Nirvāna praised by the Noble Ones. These are the three special qualities of red sandalwood that are present in Nirvāna.Mil.321

Xuanzang was told this tale concerning the harvesting of sandalwood and a tree similar to it. “In the south of this country (Malakūta), bordering the sea, are the Malaya Mountains, remarkable for their high peaks and precipices, their deep valleys and mountain torrents. Here is found the white sandalwood tree and the *candaneva* tree. These two are much alike and the latter can only be distinguished by going in the height of summer to the top of some hill and then looking at a great distance great serpents may be seen entwining it; thus it is known. Its wood is naturally cold and therefore serpents twine round it. After having noted the tree, they shoot an arrow into it to mark it. In the winter after the snakes have gone, the tree is cut down.” Similar stories about where sandlewood grows and the serpants or dragons that live around it are to be found in Sanskrit works such as the *Amarakośa* and the *Kāvyamīmāṃsā*.

Medical uses for *Candana*

Bark: With root bark of*Solanum torvum* and *Achyranthes aspera* for malaria. Oil: For enlarged spleen, with *Lepidium*, *Nerium oleander*, *Nymphaea*, root of *Michelia* and almonds for dysentery; in a paste and applied for headaches, skin complaints, burns and fever inflammation. Oil from heart wood: as diuretic, diaphoretic, refrigerant, expectorant and for dysuria. Oil from seeds: For skin diseases.

Asiatic Cheetah, *Acinonyx jabatus* *ventaicus* S.i.198. This large predatory cat has a lean body and small head, a creamy\-yellow coat with black and brown spots and a white underside. In medieval times and even in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century cheetahs were captured and trained for hunting. The last sighting of a cheetah in India was in 1948 and now the animal is found only in Iran. The Indians have long confused the cheetah with the leopard and both the Hindi and Bengali word *cheeta* is used for both. Thus the Pāḷi word may refer to either creature also.

It lives in lightly forested country in the neighborhood of villages and feeds on paddy left over after the harvest, grass seeds, berries, nectar and insects. The call of the yellow\-throated sparrow is similar to that of the house sparrow but more pleasant. The tinkling of the ornaments in a woman’s hair was said to resemble the chirping of the *cirīṭa* Ja.v.202.

The spotted deer is India’s most common deer and sometimes form herds of up to 50 or more animals. The Buddha said that “geese, herons, elephants and spotted deer are all frightened of the lion, regardless of the size of their bodies” S.ii.279.

Chitra Turtle, *Chitra indica*, Ja.vi.162\-4. This turtle has a large round soft shell, olive or grey in color, a long narrow head and eyes situated close to its comparatively short snout. The distinctive inverted chevron mark on its neck probably gave the turtle its Pāḷi name which means “marked crest”. This turtle lives in the Ganges and Yamnua and their tributaries and feeds on fish and carrion. In ancient Indian cosmology, the four elephants that held up the world were believed to stand on the back of such a turtle. The *cittakadhara kumma* mentioned in the *Milindapañha* cannot be this creature because it was said to avoid going in the water Mil.408. See [Kacchapa](/define/Kacchapa).

A yak tail fly whisk became associated with status and was also one of the symbols of royalty, along with the white umbrella, turban, shoes, sword and conch Ja.ii.330. The Buddha said that ascetics committed to virtue and simplicity would not use yak tail whisks D.i.7. Gods holding such whisks often flank images of the Buddha and bodhisattvas from ancient India.

The Buddha mentioned crickets chirping in the forest at night A.iii.397. In Sanskrit literature the Pāḷi equivilants of both *cīrilikā* and *jhillika* are used for an insect that sings loudly in forests during hot summer days and probably refer to the cicada. Perhaps both the Pāḷi and Sanskrit names were used interchangeably for both creatures.

The Buddha said: “The wise say that the strongest fetters are not made of iron, wood or *dabba*, but of the longing for jewelery, of precious stones, offspring and wives.” Dhp.345. The *Buddhacarita* mentions the sharp edges of *dabba* leaves Bc.6.28.

The north Indian bird with the most stick\-like legs is the Black\-necked Stork, *Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus*, a large bird with a black head, neck and back, white wings and belly, long bright red legs and a massive black beak. Solitary birds are often seen in marshes and shallow ponds where they eat fish, crustaceans and frogs. Sanskrit literature mentions a bird named *koyaṣṭi*, meaning “stick\-like legs” which may refer to lapwings. See [Dindibha](/define/Dindibha).

A water snake described as small, harmless, with a large head and a needle\-like tail Ja.i.361 Ja.iii.16 Ja.vi.194. This could be the Buff\-striped Keelback, *Amphiesma stolata*. This little snake has a relatively short body and a long thin tail, almost a quarter of its total length, large eyes and is usually olive\-brown with buff stripes around its body. A common snake, it is often seen along river banks and in marshy areas where it feeds almost exclusively on frogs and toads. Daniel describes the keelback as “a remarkably inoffensive and gentle little snake”. When alarmed, rather than fleeing, it curls up, flattens its body and distends itself by deep inhalations.

The seven types of grain usually mentioned in the Tipiṭaka are *[sāli](/define/sāli)*, *[vīhi](/define/vīhi)*, *[yava](/define/yava)*, *[godhūma](/define/godhūma)*, *[kaṅgu](/define/kaṅgu)*, *[varaka](/define/varaka)* and *[kudrūsa](/define/kudrūsa)* Vin.iv.264. Elsewhere, the first two of these are included in a list of edible seeds M.i.457. Grains like wheat and barley have a awn (*[sāka](/define/sāka)*) at the end of the husk. Sometimes rice or barley was cooked and then dried, probably to preserve it. Once, during a famine, some monks were given such food which was meant to feed horses. They pounded it in a mortar and then ate it Vin.iii.6. During various auspicious occasions grains of popped rice or wheat (*[lāja](/define/lāja)*) together with flower petals of different colors would be scattered Ja.ii.240 Ja.vi.42. Small balls of popped rice held together with honey or molasses (*madulāja*) were a popular sweet as they still are today Ja.iii.539 Ja.iv.214. In a ritual called *saddha*, done for the benefit of departed ancestors, small balls of either rice or wheat dough called *piṇḍiṇ* were used A.i.166 A.v.269. Grain merchants had a reputation for mixing chaff with the grain they sold Ja.vi.110. The Jātaka advises the prudent man: “Regulary visiting the threashing floor, the barn, the herds and the fields he should have grain carefully measured and stored in granaries, and have it carefully measured and cooked at home”Ja.vi.297. See [Aparaṇṇa](/define/Aparaṇṇa), [Godhūma](/define/Godhūma), [Kaṅgu](/define/Kaṅgu), [Nīvāra](/define/Nīvāra), [Taṇḍula](/define/Taṇḍula) and [Yava](/define/Yava).

Dindibha

One or another of the four species of lapwing found in northern India, probably the Red\-wattled Lapwing, Hindi *titeeri* or *titi*, *Vanellus indicus* Ja.vi.538, known as *tiṭṭibha* in Sanskrit. This large plover is brown above, white below, with black breast, head and neck and a white band running from the eyes down the side of the neck to the breast. It also has a bright red wattle in front of each eye. The lapwing is commonly seen in fields, open country and near water, running in short bursts as it hunts for food. At the slightest intrusion or sign of danger it makes a loud piercing “did he do it” call becoming increasingly frantic until the danger or the intruder passes. See Daṇḍamānavaka.

This large cat has a yellow coat marked with black rosettes and a white underside. Nocturnal and solitary by habit, leopards live in thick jungle and lurk around villages where they prey on livestock and sometimes kill and even eat humans. Black leopards, called panthers, are sometimes born in the same litter with the normal spotted ones. The monk Tāḷaputa described himself as living in a forest grove “resounding with the cries of peacocks and herons and favored by leopards and tigers” Th.1113. Royal chariots were upholstered with leopard or tiger skins Ja.vi.503. Leopards are now almost extinct in northern India. See [Kālasīha](/define/Kālasīha).

Ewes were called *urāṇi* Ja.v.241 and rams *meṇḍa* or *urabbha*. Sheep were known for their long fleece which was used to make cloth and carpets S.ii.228 M.i.228. Mutton must have been eaten too because there is mention of sheep butchers M.i.343 S.ii.256. Bows were sometimes made out of ram’s horns Ja.ii.61 Ja.vi.68. The Buddha considered sheep to be gentle harmless creatures, like cows Sn.309. A group of monks who spent the three months of the rainy season without doing any spiritual practice other than maintaining strict silence were rebuked by the Buddha as being like dumb sheep Vin.i.159.In the Jātaka, there is a story of a proud brahmin who was flattered when a ram lowered its head to him only to find that it butted him rather than paid him reverence.

In one place a donkey recently relieved of its load is described as standing around looking sad and contemplative M.i.334. Because of their ability to carry heavy loads donkeys were used mainly as pack animals although they were sometimes harnessed to chariots D.ii.343. Donkey fat was used as medicine Vin.i.199.

Gaha

Gharial, *Gavialis gangeticus*, Hindi *gah*, *gharial* or *nakar* S.iv.157. The Pāḷi name means “one that seizes”. This species of crocodile differs from the better\-known varieties by having a very long narrow snout often with a large fleshy nodule on the end. Gharials live in the tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and in small streams and ponds where they eat almost exclusively fish. Although fierce\-looking and sometimes growing up to 7 m long, gharials never attack humans unless provoked. The Buddha said that a man seeing a pleasant\-looking river might go for a swim and allow himself to be carried along with the current. Seeing this, a more perceptive bystander might warn the swimmer of the presence of undercurrents, rapids, gharials and demons It.114. The gharial is now rare in northern India and confined to a few nature reserves. See [Kumbhīla](/define/Kumbhīla).

Gijjha

Vulture, sometimes *[gaddha](/define/gaddha)*, Hindi *gidh*. The two commonest species of vultures in northern India are the Long\-Billed Vulture, *Gyps indicus*, and the Indian White\-backed Vulture, *Gyps bengalensis*. The first is light to dark\-brown with paler tips to the feathers and pale brown below. It is a sociable and silent bird. The second is brownish\-black with a whitish ruff at the base of the neck. It is a gregarious bird, roosting and nesting in groups and producing an occasional harsh screech. Both birds have naked heads and necks. The Jātaka mentions a spotted or variegated vulture although no bird fitting this description is found in India today Ja.vi.106. Vultures were often seen with dogs and jackals eating bodies in charnel grounds Sn.201. Hunters used to trap them Ja.iii.330 M.i.130 for their feathers, which were used as flights on arrows M.i.429 and perhaps for their meat. They were believed to be able to see a carcass from a hundred *yojanas* away Ja.iii.331. A famous rocky crag in Rājagaha where the Buddha sometimes used to reside was called the Vulture’s Peak, apparently because vultures perched on the rocks there. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was occasionally reborn as a vulture Ja.ii.50 Ja.iii.330 Ja.iv.485.

Domestic Cattle, also *[gavi](/define/gavi)*, *siṅgī*, “the horned one” and *vasā* Sn.26 Vin.ii.300, large mammals of the order Bovidae, the most common species in India being *Bos indicus*. The different types of domestic cattle recognized included suckling calves, *dhenupa*; yearlings, *taruṇavaccha*; milch cows, *dhenu* or *khīranikā*; red cows, *rohiṇī*; heifers, *vacchaka*; cows ready to be mated, *godharaṇī*; breeding cows *paveṇi*; bulls, *usabha*; oxen, *goṇa* and draught oxen, *balivadda* A.ii.108 M.i.226. Cattle were of different colors \- black, white, red, tawny, dappled and grey A.iii.213.

There is little evidence in the Tipiṭaka of cows being regarded with the universal reverence they were to be given in later Hinduism. The Buddha described cows as harmless creatures, gentle like sheep, who willingly give pails of milk Sn.309. He condemned Vedic sacrifice at which cattle were slaughtered. After being convinced by the Buddha of the cruelty and futility of such blood sacrifices the Brahmin Uggatasarīra released all the cattle he was about to slaughter with this benediction: “I hereby grant them life. Let them be fed with green grass, let them drink cool water, and let the cool breezes blow upon them”D.i.148. But for some people at least, beef was an ordinary part of their diet. We read of a butcher or his apprentice displaying a butchered cow for sale at a cross\-road M.i.58. Leather, including that made out of cow hides, was used to make harnesses, bags, shields, mats, drums and water skins Bv.1.31 Ja.vi.431 Vin.i.194 Vin.ii.122. There is mention of a man killing a calf, flaying it and using the skin to make a scabbard Ja.v.106. Leather working was a recognized craft although it was considered a low one Vin.iv.6.

Cattle were a symbol of wealth and to have many was a source of pride and joy S.i.6. Cattle rearing is mentioned together with accountancy, archery and royal service as a worthy occupation M.i.85 Vin.iv.6. The five bounties of cows were milk, cream, butter milk, butter and ghee, this last one being considered the best A.ii.94 Vin.i.244. The cowherd’s job was to take the animals out to graze and bring them back each evening A.i.204, pick the eggs of parasitic flies off them, dress their wounds and light smoking fires at night to protect them from mosquitoes A.v.347. During the growing season, watchmen had to make sure cows did not wander into the crops and eat them or tread them down D.iii.38 S.iv.195.

Cattle wandered through the streets of towns and villages and could injure or even kill people Ud.8. Aggressive bulls sometimes had their horns cut off to prevent them from hurting anyone A.iv.375. Cattle were marked, probably by cutting, as is done today, rather than by branding, and according to Pāṇinī these marks should be made on either the ears or the rump. Bulls were castrated Ja.iv.364 Thi.440. Cattle pulled ploughs and carts, their dung was smeared on the floor of homes Vin.iii.15, fed to pigs D.iii.347, used as a fuel Ja.vi.508 and as a cleaning agent S.iii.131. A concoction of cow urine and yellow myrobalan was considered a cure for jaundice Vin.i.205.

Cattle also had a part to play in certain Brahmanical rituals. The Tipiṭaka describes a ceremony where the king would drink milk from a teat of a cow with a calf of the same color, the queen would drink milk from a second teat, the court Brahman from the third teat and milk from the fourth teat would be offered to the sacred fire A.ii.207. The torch used to ignite a person’s funeral pyre was smeared with cow dung A.ii.94, and Brahmans believed they could make themselves ritually pure by touching cow dung A.v.265. It was observed that if cows have cause to be frightened they would give less milk Ja.i.388.

One of the 32 special characteristics of a Mahāpurisa is having eyelashes like those of a cow D.ii.18.

Godhā

Common Indian Monitor, Hindi *goh*, *Varanus bengalensis* D.i.9. This large lizard is olive, brown or grey above, yellowish below and with a dark streak on the temples. It can grow up to 1.70 m in length with the tail often being longer than the body. It lives comfortably in almost any environment and is commonly seen peering out of burrows in termite mounds and from between rocks. Although the Indian monitor is completely carnivorous, eating small animals, birds, eggs, insects and carrion, there is a reference to one eating figs Ja.ii.118. This belief may have arisen because the monitor is sometimes seen high in fig trees where it waits for birds. When termites would swarm after rain, monitors would dash about trying to catch them Ja.ii.148. Monitors were hunted, their flesh being considered a delicacy. Men would go into the forest with spades and dogs to track them down. They would light fires at the mouth of termite mounds to drive the monitors out and then catch and roast them Ja.i.488 Ja.iii.106. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a monitor Ja.ii.487.

Wheat, Hindi *godhum*, *Triticum sativum* D.iii.71 Vin.iv.264. Wheat is an annual or sometimes perennial grass of which there are many varieties and which has flat leaves and spiked seeds which are ground to produce flour. A very ancient variety of Indian wheat and perhaps the one mentioned in the Tipiṭaka, is *Triticum dicocum*. After rice, wheat was the most important grain in northern India. There is mention of “edibles made of flour” Vin.i.248

Looking like a cross between a horse and a bull, the nilgai is India’s largest antelope. It has an iron\-blue coat, high shoulders that slope down to a low rump and the male has short conical horns. The nilgai is most often seen at dusk lurking in the jungle bordering fields in preparation for raiding them when darkness falls. Because he stood aloof from debates, at least at some period of his career, the Buddha was accused of lacking the confidence to participate in such events. The ascetic Nigrodha said of him: “As a nilgai circling around keeps to the fringes, so does the monk Gotama” D.iii.38.

Harītaka

The fruit of the Chebulic or Yellow Myrobalan, Hindi *haritaki*, *Terminalia chebula* J.i.80 M.iii.127, a medium\-sized tree usually with a short crooked trunk, dark\-gray bark, elliptic leaves and whitish flowers. Together with *[āmalaka](/define/āmalaka)* and *[vibhītaka](/define/vibhītaka)* the fruit of this tree is one of the “*triphalā*” or three fruits, long credited in traditional Indian medicine with powerful curative properties. When ripe, the bright\-yellow fruits are allowed to fall and then collected and used in tanning and as a medicine. While staying at Uruvelā the Buddha plucked a yellow myrobalan fruit Vin.i.30. According to the *Mahāvastu*, the Buddha planted a Yellow Myrobalan tree when he was at Uruvelā. It adds the comment: “The myrobalans which grew from this tree are today known as the Consecrated Myrobalan Wood”Mvu.iii.311. When the Chinese monk Yijing was in India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century he was told of ways to use yellow myrobalan as a medicine. “Take equal measures of *harītaka* bark, dry ginger and granulated sugar. Pound the first two into a powder and mix it with the sugar and some water and then form the paste into pills. Take no more than ten pills in the morning and do not abstain from eating. No more than two or three doses will be sufficient to cure a patient with diarrhea. It will dissolve the gas in the stomach, dispense cold and help digestion... If no granulated sugar is available maltose or honey can be used. If one chews one piece of *harītaka* and swallows the juice every day, one will be free from disease the whole of one’s life.”

Medical uses for *Harītaka*

Bark: As diuretic, cardiotonic, for eczema, mouth sores. Fruit: For dysentery, enlarged spleen, externally for measles, applied to inflammation of the eyes, constipation, coughs, bronchitis, as a gargle for inflammation of the mouth, laxative, cardiac tonic. Powder of the fruit dentrifive for gums.

Hatthin

Asian Elephant, *Elephas maximus*, also called *mātaṅga* or *[vāraṇa](/define/vāraṇa)*, while large impressively tusked males were called *danta*, *gaja*, *kāhīti*, *kuñjara* or *[nāga](/define/nāga)* Ja.iv.494 Ja.vi.497. A male in must was *pabhinna* Dhp.324. Females were called *uccākaṇerukā* M.i.178 or *kareṇukā* Ja.ii.343 and a female with protruding tusks was called *kaḷārikā* M.i.178. An elephant that had reached 60 years old was called *saṭṭhihāyana* M.i.229 and calves were known as *hatthikalabha*, *kaṇeru* or *susanāga* A.iv.435 D.ii.254. Elephants with pink spotted foreheads, a sign of age, were called *padumin* D.i.75 M.iii.93. Several other types of elephants are mentioned, such as the *vāmanakikā* but it is not clear what distinguished them from others Ja.v.416 M.i.178. The Pāḷi, Bengali and Hindi word *hatthī* means “one with a hand” and refers to the dexterous way elephants use their trunks.

Slightly smaller than its African cousin, the Asian elephant has grey wrinkled skin, a long trunk, a two\-domed head and drooping ears. They can grow up to 3 meters at the shoulders and weigh as much as 5,000 kilograms. Asian elephants prefer thick or light jungle and eat the leaves, bark and fruit of trees, grass and aquatic vegetation. They will also raid fields and orchards. In his famous parable of the blind men and the elephant the Buddha described the elephant’s ears as being like a winnowing basket, its tusks (*danta* or *hatthidanta*) like plough poles, the body like a granary, the legs like pillars, the tail is like a pestle and the tuft of the tail like a broom Ud.68\-9. The frontal lobes of the elephant’s head were called “pots” (*kumbha*) and the trusks, the small tusks on females, were known as *kaḷārikā* M.178. Temporin, the odorous tar\-like secretion that oozes from the males during must, was called *kaṭuka* Dhp.324. The ancient Indians revered the elephant for its strength, nobility and intelligence and elephants are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka more than any other animal. Elephants lived in certain forests M.iii.132, probably because they offered better shelter, food and water than other places. Males were believed to avoid the cows and their calves so that they would not be bothered by them or have to eat the leaves and grass that they had already cropped or drink the water they had muddied A.iv.435. It was noticed that elephants have very particular behavior; when they charge they spread their ears and make their tails erect Vin.ii.194, they sniff the dung of other elephants A.iii.157 and they dislike heat D.ii.266. Males regularly go into must when temporin flows from their ears Dhp.324 and they become aggressive and unruly so that their mahouts have to hold them in check Dhp.326. At such times they may kill people or even knock down dwellings Ja.iv.494. Elephants enjoy swimming and they amuse themselves by squirting water into their ears and over their backs A.v.201. They pull up lotus stalks, wash them to get the mud off and then eat them S.ii.269. A bull elephant might be seven or eight cubits high A.v.201 and some could live for 60 years or more M.i.229. Elephants were domesticated in India at least 1,500 years before the Buddha’s time. Trackers skilled in reading the marks left by them \- footprints, the scrapings of their tusks on trees, broken foliage, etc \- were employed to find the animals M.i.178. Domesticated elephants would be used to capture the wild ones M.iii.132. Once caught, the trainer had to subdue the creature’s forest habits, memories and behavior, subdue its distress, fret and fever over missing the forest, and get it used to towns and people. The tamer used gentle kind words and the elephant would gradually respond and begin eating again. Then the trainer would teach the elephant commands like “Take up!” “Put down!” “Go forward!” “Go back!” “Get up!” “Sit down!” After that, it would be taught what was called “endurance.” A plank was tied to the elephant’s trunk, a man would sit on its back and then it would be surrounded by other men who would poke it with poles and spears and make a great racket while the trainer would command it not to move M.iii.132\-33. To mount a trained elephant the mahout would take his hook and say: “Give me your foot” and the elephant would bend its knee so the mahout climbs on its back Thi.49. When domesticated elephants heard the roar of the lion they would strain at and break the leather bonds that held them, defecate, panic and run around A.ii.32. Because of their value, there were veterinarians specializing in elephant health Ja.i.485. Ivory was a much\-prized product. Bracelets, boxes for eye\-salve, caskets, ornament boxes in fantastic shapes, vases and anklets were made out of it. There is mention of a mirror handle being made out of ivory Ja.v.302. There was a bazaar of ivory workers in Vārānasi Ja.i.320. A type of curved wall peg was called “elephant tusk” Vin.ii.113 and one way of wearing the monks” under robe was to role it up at the front rather than fold it, a style known as “the elephant’s trunk” Vin.ii.136. The capitals of pillars in buildings were sometimes carved to resemble elephants Vin.ii.169. Domesticated elephants were used for work, transportation, in warfare and to enhance royal glory. The elephant brigade was one of the four traditional branches of the army, the others being cavalry, chariots and infantry D.i.137. Being crushed by an elephant was a form of capital punishment J.i.200. In battle, elephants would take great care to protect their softest and most vulnerable part, their trunk M.i.415. A large tusked elephant was an essential possession for a monarch. King Ajātasattu rode his royal tusker from Rājagaha to meet the Buddha at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove D.i.49. Once, the Buddha and Ānanda were bathing in the river at Sāvatthī when Seta, King Pasenadi’s elephant, arrived to the accompaniment of music. Soon an admiring crowd had gathered to watch, commenting “What a beauty! What a sight! What a delight for the eye! What a body! Now that really is an elephant!” A.iii.345. An elephant fit to be a royal mount in war had to have four qualities. It had to respond well to training. In battle it had to destroy other elephants and their mahouts as well as cavalry, chariots and their drivers and footmen. It was expected to endure the injuries of spears, swords, arrows and axes and the din of drums, conchs and other noises, and it was expected to go in whichever direction the mahout directed it A.ii.115.

One of the skills taught to princes along with horsemanship, archery, swordsmanship and chariot driving, was the art of training, riding and caring for elephants A.iii.152. This was called elephant lore A.iii.326. During a food shortage the king’s elephant died and people ate it Vin.i.218. The rare white elephant was particularly prized Ja.i.319 and one of the accoutrements of a universal Monarch was a pure white elephant of sevenfold strength D.ii.174. The mount of Indra, the king of the gods, was a magnificent elephant named Erāvana Sn.379 or sometimes Maghavā. S.i.229. Some lay people were rich enough to be able to own elephants. When Soṇa became a monk, he said he had renounced everything he owned including “a herd of seven elephants”, the implication being that he had been very wealthy Vin.i.184.

The Buddha seems to have had a special fondness for elephants. The animal’s mindful and deliberate behavior and particularly the male’s penchant for living alone in the jungle, impressed him. “On this matter the enlightened sage and the elephant with tusks as long as plough poles agree, they both love the solitude of the forest” Ud.42. In some ways the Buddha even considered elephants to be better than humans. The elephant trainer Pessa once said to him: “Humans are a tangle while animals are straightforward. I can drive an elephant undergoing training and in the time it takes to make a trip to and from Campa, that elephant will display every kind of deception, duplicity, trickery and fraud. But our servants, messengers and employees, they say one thing, do another and think something else.” The Buddha agreed with this observation M.i.340. He often compared himself to or was compared by others with an elephant A.ii.36. When Doṇa encountered him sitting at the foot of a tree, he appeared “beautiful, faith\-inspiring, with calm senses and a serene mind, utterly composed and controlled like a tamed, alert, perfectly trained elephant” A.ii.36. The Buddha never looked over his shoulder when he wanted to see behind him but turned around completely as does an elephant. This was called his “elephant look” D.ii.122.

Throughout the Tipiṭaka, the Buddha advised his disciples to respond to difficulties as would an elephant. “I shall endure abuse as a bull elephant in battle endures the arrows shot from the bow. For indeed, ill\-natured people are many”Dhp.320. “Formerly this mind wandered wherever it wished, where it liked and as it pleased. But today I shall completely control it as a mahout controls an elephant in must” Dhp.326. “Rejoice in awareness and guard your mind well. Pull yourself out of evil as does an elephant stuck in the mud” Dhp.327. “If you do not find a wise, zealous and virtuous companion to wander with, then like a king abandoning his conquered realm, wander alone like a bull elephant in the forest” Dhp.329. Elephants are frequently mentioned in the Jātaka where they are usually depicted as noble, kindly and intelligent creatures. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as an elephant Ja.i.319 Ja.i.444 Ja.iii.174 Ja.iv.90 and once as a human he worked as an elephant trainer Ja.ii.94.

Haṃsa

A term for water birds in general and for the Bar\-headed Goose in particular, sometimes also *[rājahaṃsa](/define/rājahaṃsa)*, Hindi *hans* or *raj hans*, *Anser indicus* Ja.v.356. About the size of the domestic goose, this beautiful bird has gray, brown and white plumage with a white head and neck marked by two distinctive black bands. The bird’s gentle musical “*aang aang aang*” call is often praised in ancient Indian literature. The famous ornithologist Salim Ali describes it as “one of the most unforgettable and exhilarating sounds” to be heard in nature. Vaṅgīsa addressed the Buddha saying: “Quickly send forth your melodious voice, oh Beautiful One. Like geese stretching out their necks, honk gently with your soft well\-modulated voice” Sn.350. Bar\-headed geese are often seen during the winter feeding in swamps and fields, and then in mid\-March they fly off to nest in Tibet. To the Buddha this migratory behavior was suggestive of detachment. “Mindful people exert themselves. They are not attached to any home. Like geese that quit their lakes, they leave one abode after another behind” Dhp.91. “Geese fly the path to the sun, sages fly by their psychic powers. Having defeated Māra and his army the wise are led away from the world” Dhp.175. Piṅgiya used the geese’s arrival back in northern India in October as a metaphor for the coming of something wonderful. “Just as a bird might leave a small wood to dwell in a forest full of fruit, so do I, having left narrow\-minded teachers, come to He of Wide Vision, like a goose arriving at a great lake” Sn.1134. One of the most beautiful legends in the whole of the Buddhist tradition comes from the Sanskrit *Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra* and concerns a bar\-headed goose. Once, while walking through the palace garden, Prince Siddhattha saw a goose fall from the sky with an arrow lodged in its wing. He gently nestled the bird in his lap, extracted the arrow and anointed the wound with oil and honey. Soon afterwards, Devadatta sent a message to the palace saying that he had shot the bird and demanding that it be returned to him. Siddhattha replied to the message by saying “If the goose was dead I would return it forthwith. But as it is still alive you have no right to it.” Devadatta sent a second message arguing that it was his skill that had downed the goose and as such it belonged to him. Again Siddhattha refused to give his cousin the bird and asked that an assembly of wise men be called to settle the dispute. This was done and after discussing the matter for some time the most senior of the wise men gave his opinion, saying “The living belongs to he who cherishes and preserves life, not to he who tries to destroy life”. The assembly agreed with this and Prince Siddhattha was allowed to keep the goose.

According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as a bar\-headed goose Ja.iii.208 Ja.iv.246 Ja.iv.423.

Indagopaka

Red Velvet Mite, Hindi *indra*, an arthropod of the family Trombidiidae Ja.iv.258 Ja.vi.497 Th.1063 of which several species live in northern India. The Pāḷi name for these small creatures means “Indra’s herdsman” and was probably related to the fact that they emerge from the ground during the rainy season. Indra was the Brahmanical god associated with thunder and storms. These mites have a bright\-red rounded body with a velvety appearance and are parasitic on spiders and insects. We read of a monk who made a round hut out of red clay which looked “beautiful, lovely and pleasing like a little red velvet mite” Vin.iii.42. A type of cloth made in Gandhāra and used to upholster chariots was said to be the color of these mites Ja.vi.500.

No similar distinctions can be detected between *[ikkāsa](/define/ikkāsa)*,*jatu*, *[ojā](/define/ojā)* and [sajjulasa](/define/sajjulasa),the names given in the Tipiṭaka for the substances extracted from or exuded by various plants. The four types of jatu mentioned are *hiṅgujatu*, *taka*, *takapattī* and *lakapaṇṇa* Vin.i.201. The first of these came from the *[hiṅgu](/define/hiṅgu)* but the trees from which the others came are unknown. *Jatu* is also one of the medicines mentioned in the Vinaya, the others being tallow, roots, astringents decoctions, leaves, fruits, salts and ointments Vin.i.251. *Ojā* means “nutriment” and was sometimes used to mean tree sap. *[Ikkāsa](/define/Ikkāsa)* had some adhesive properties because it would be mixed with whitewash to help it adhere to a surface Vin.ii.151. The sticky lime (*[lepa](/define/lepa)*) used to trap birds and animals was apparently made from a type of resin or sap S.v.146. Today birdlime is made from the sap of Cordia myxa, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus religiosa, Loranthus odoratus and several other trees. The latex (khīra) found in certain plants was so called because of its resemblance to milk.

About half the size of the domestic hen, the jacana has a chocolate\-brown body, white wings, a yellow strip on the side of its neck and a black “necklace” on the upper breast. The toes are elongated for walking over lily leaves and floating vegetation. During the breeding season the male grows a long, slender sickle\-shaped tail. The jacana is often seen singly or in large flocks in lakes and ponds and eats vegetation, insects and mollusks. It has a nasal mewing “*tewn tewn*” call which, according to the commentary, sounded like “Live! Live!” and gave the bird its name. The *Mahābhārata* describes the pheasant\-tailed jacana as being “red, yellow and brown”. In later Indian literature the *jīvaṃjīvaka* was mythologized into a two\-headed bird.

Kacchapa

Turtle, sometimes also *kuma* or *[kumma](/define/kumma)*, reptiles of the order Chelonia. Turtle live in marine or freshwater habitats while tortoises, sometimes called land turtles, are terrestrial. Four species of marine turtles swim in Indian waters, the most common being the Hawksbill Turtle, Hindi *samudra kachakra*, *Eretmotochelys imbricata*. The Buddha was probably referring to this turtle in his well\-known statement about the rarity of being born human and of coming into contact with the Dhamma. “Monks, suppose this great earth were covered with water and a man were to throw a yoke in it and blown by the wind it were to drift north, south, east and west. Suppose also that once every hundred years a blind turtle were to surface. What do you think? What are the chances that the blind turtle were to put its head through the yoke?” “It is very unlikely, Lord.” “Monks, it is just as unlikely that one will be reborn as a human, just as unlikely that a Tathāgata should appear in the world, just as unlikely that the Dhamma should be taught to the world” S.v.457.

Freshwater turtles are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka although it is not possible to identify any of the several species that inhabit the rivers and ponds of northern India. They were described as having four legs, a neck like a pole and a body round like a banyan tree Ja.ii.152. Some of the behavior of turtles that were observed included floating on the surface of the water but on seeing someone quickly submerging, coming out of the water to bask in the sun, digging burrows in the banks of rivers and withdrawing into their shells at the first sign of danger Mil.370\-2. Freshwater turtles were eaten and we read of those living in lakes being speared with harpoons S.ii.227. They were believed to be able to tell when there was going to be a drought Ja.ii.80 and at such times would burrow into the mud trying to keep wet Ja.i.331. If a turtle was on the bank of a river and a predator like a jackal aproached, it would withdraw into its shell and remain still S.iv.177. A thing or event that was impossible was referred to as “a turtle’s hair” Ja.iii.477. The Buddha said the meditative monk should in some ways imitate the land turtle. “Just as the turtle withdraws its limbs into its shell, a monk should withdraw his mind and thoughts” S.i.7.

Kanikāra

Sometimes also *[kanikāra](/define/kanikāra)* or *kannikāra*, Hindi *kanak* *champa*, *Pterospermum acerifolium* A.v.61 Bv.27.19 D.ii.111 Ja.v.295 Ja.iv.499 M.ii.14, a tall majestic deciduous tree with rounded leaves, green on top and grayish\-white beneath and a large yellowish\-orange colored sweet\-smelling flower. Monks” robes were described as being as yellow as the *kanikāra* flower Ja.ii.25. The flower is comparable to a net of gold or a flame Ja.vi.535. In the Jātaka there is a story in which a young woman tells her mother that if she dies “collect my bones, burn them, raise a monument and plant a *kanikāra* tree there. Then, when it breaks into blossom in the spring, when the winter is over, you will remember me, my mother, and say ‘Such was the beauty of my daughter’ ” Ja.v.302. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang mentioned that all the roads around Rājagaha were lined with *kanikāra* trees and in the spring the forests would become golden\-colored with their blossoms.

Kapi

A general term for monkeys, sometimes also *[makkaṭa](/define/makkaṭa)* Ja.ii.269 Ja.iii.355 Ja.v.68, primates of the superfamily Cercopithecidae. The various words for monkey in the Tipiṭaka seem to be used loosely and interchangeably as is suggested by the mention of a large black\-faced monkey, a clear reference to the Hanuman Langur, and a small red\-faced monkey, a reference to the Rhesus Macaque. In both cases the word *[makkaṭa](/define/makkaṭa)* is used Ja.ii.445. However, many of the numerous stories about monkeys in the Jātakas would seem to refer mainly to the macaque because this monkey would have been more familiar to most people and because of its more human\-like appearance and often amusing antics.

Monkeys pull faces and threaten people Ja.ii.70 and while moving through the forest they grab a branch and let go of it only to grab another S.ii.95 Sn.791. Hunters used to go into the forests of the Himalayan foothills and set traps of sticky pitch to catch them. The more curious monkeys would touch the pitch, get stuck and while trying to free one paw would get their other paws stuck. The hunters would then kill them, put the carcass on a spit and cook them over a fire S.v.146. Mahākassapa said that a monk who wears rag robes and yet is conceited, is like a monkey wrapped in a lion’s skin Th.1081. Street entertainers had monkeys which were trained to play with snakes and to do tricks Ja.iii.198. In the Jātaka, monkeys are depicted as having the best and worst human traits and attitudes. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was often reborn as a monkey. See [Sākhāmiga](/define/Sākhāmiga), [Sākhāssita](/define/Sākhāssita) and [Vānara](/define/Vānara).

Kapittha

Wood\-Apple Tree, sometimes *[kapittha](/define/kapittha)*, *kaviṭṭha* and *kapitthana*, Hindi *kabith*, *Feronia elephantum* Ja.v.38 Ja.vi.529 Vin.iv.34, a medium\-sized deciduous tree with spiny branches and a large, globular, grayish\-colored, hard woody fruit containing numerous seeds embedded in an aromatic pulp. The pulp has an acidic taste and is used to make chutneys and to acidify curd, and the gum from the tree is used to treat diarrhea. The Buddha mentioned the wood apple along with the *[assattha](/define/assattha)*, *[nigrodha](/define/nigrodha)*, *[pilakkha](/define/pilakkha)*, *[udumbara](/define/udumbara)* and the *[kacchaka](/define/kacchaka)* as having “tiny seeds, huge bodies and growing around other trees so that they bend, twist and split” S.v.96. In fact, although the wood apple often grows up on other trees it never actually kills them. One who wants wood apples will knock them out of the tree by throwing a wood apple at them Mil.189.

Kapiñjala

Grey Francolin, also *[vaṭṭakā](/define/vaṭṭakā)*, *Francolinus pondicerianus* Ja.i.212 Ja.vi.538 Vin.iii.48. About half the size of the domestic chicken, this bird has a blotched\-chestnut back, wings and tail, a lighter\-colored breast and a rufus throat circumscribed by a black line. The sexes are the same except that the male has spurs on its legs. The grey francolin favors dry scrub and grassland and feeds on insects and seeds. When disturbed it flies off with a loud whirling sound. It is also a fast runner. Hunters would imitate the francolin’s call to attract them and then catch them with nets Ja.i.208. The *Gṛhya Sūtra* says that feeding a baby boy francolin flesh will impart to it the bird’s plump and contented\-looking appearance. The Jātaka says that the reason why francolins are plump is because their minds are content and still, because they do not stray far from home and because they maintain themselves with whatever food they get Ja.iii.313. The Nidānakathā mentions monasteries being decorated with rows of geese and francolins, probably painted or molded in plaster Ja.i.92.

Kapota

Blue Rock Pigeon, sometimes also *[pārāvata](/define/pārāvata)*, Hindi *kabutar* or *parawa*, *Columba livia* Ja.i.244. A familiar bird the world over, the blue rock pigeon is slate grey with a shining metallic green and purple sheen on its breast and neck and pink legs and eyes. The English name is due to the pigeon’s habit of nesting and roosting on cliffs and in rocky places. The pigeon is as much at home in lightly\-forested and open country as it is in villages and towns. The Buddha described old bones as being pigeon\-colored Dhp.149. One of the places around Rājagaha where monks sometimes used to stay was called Pigeon’s Cave Ud.39. According to the 5<sup>th</sup> Pillar Edict, King Asoka forbade the killing of white pigeons and village pigeons. The *Arthaśāstra* mentions tying messages to the pigeon’s legs. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a pigeon Ja.i.242.

Kappāsika

Cotton Bush, Hindi *kapas* Ja.ii.286, of which about eight species grow in northern India. The species mentioned in the Tipiṭaka might be *Gossypium arboreum* as Brahmins make their sacred threads only from this type, suggesting its antiquity. This species of cotton is a large shrub with slender, sometimes purple branches, small, smooth leaves and large, beautiful purple flowers. The round black seeds are embedded in a white fluffy wool\-like fiber which can be made into thread S.v.284 Th.104 Vin.i.271. Leaves of the cotton bush were used as a medicine Vin.i.201 and an oil can be extracted from the seeds. Cotton fiber and thread were called *[picu](/define/picu)*. Cotton cloth was the most common fabric used in ancient India. After being harvested and separated from the seed, the fiber was spun into thread and then woven into cloth D.iii.351. Nakulamātā, one of the Buddha’s female disciples, was very accomplished at spinning cotton A.iii.295 and the Brahmin Velāma once made a gift of 84,000 lengths of cotton cloth A.iv.394. Cotton was used for a variety of purposes including padding sandals Vin.i.196. When asked what should be done with his body after his final Nirvana, the Buddha said that it should be wrapped in new cloth, then in teased cotton wool and then in new cloth. That being done, it should be placed in an iron coffin and then cremated D.ii.142\-3. Referring to one of his super normal powers, the Buddha once said: “Just as a wisp of fluff or cotton when blown by the wind easily rises up into the air, so too, when the Tathāgata immerses the mind into the body and the body into the mind and he abides in a blissful and buoyant perception towards the body, his body easily rises into the air” S.v.284. Cotton was ginned with an instrument resembling a bow called *dhanuka* Ja.vi.41, *dhunaith* in Hindi.

Medical uses for *Kappāsika*

Root: For fever. Seed: For constipation, gonorrhea, catarrh, gleets and chronic cystitis.

Kappūra

Camphor, *Cinnamomum camphora*, the name of a tree and a whitish crystalline aromatic substance extracted from it and certain other trees Ja.vi.537. Camphor was used as a perfume Ja.i.290 Ja.ii.416, a medicine, to flavor water and in religious ceremonies. Ancient texts distinguished two types of camphor; “unheated” i.e. free crystals found in the wood or on the bark, and “heated” i.e. prepared by steam distillation. Both *Carakasaṃhitā* and *Suśrutasaṃhitā* mention the medicinal qualities of camphor and it is still used to treat diarrhea and as a cardiac stimulant. Because it burns with a strong incandescent light and leaves no ash, camphor has long been favored for lamps in religious offerings.

Concerning the harvesting of camphor in India, Xuanzang wrote: “The tree from which camphor scent is procured is in trunk, like the pine, but with different leaves, flowers and fruit. When the tree is first cut down and sappy it has no smell but when the wood gets dry it forms into veins and splits; then in the middle is the scent, in appearance like mica, in color like frozen snow.”Apart from the camphor tree camphor can also be extracted from *Blumea balsamifera* (Sanskrit *kukudru*, *kukkuradru* or *kukundara*), *B. densiflra*, *B. junghuhniana* and *Nardostachys grandiflora* although none of these plants except the first are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka.

Karavīka

Cuckoo, sometimes *karavī*, of which four species are found in northern India Ja.vi.539. The bird mentioned in the Tipiṭaka is probably the Indian Plaintive Cuckoo, *Cacomantis passerinus*. When young, this cuckoo is a mottled rufus and when mature, dark\-grey above, light\-grey and white below, and with a black tail tipped with white. The cuckoo is frequently celebrated in the Tipiṭaka and other Indian literature for its beautiful call Ja.v.204, a high pitched *pteer*, *pteer*, *pteer* and at other times a whistling pleasantly mournful *pi pi pi pee pee pee*. This call was considered “sweeter, more beautiful, charming and delightful than that of any other bird” D.ii.20. One of the 32 special characteristics of a Mahāpurisa is that his voice is beautiful like that of the cuckoo D.ii.18 D.iii.173.

A certain astringent medicinal decoction was also called *kasāya* Ja.v.198 Vin.i.201. This suggests that *kasāya* was derived from a plant or plants. Yijing, the Chinese monk who traveled through India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century, said that the *kasāya* was understood to be the same color as pulverized sandalwood.

The *Mahābhārata* mentions *kaṅka* circling overhead with vultures and crows and prowling around the battlefield together with jackals. As neither herons nor cranes are carrion\-eaters, the name *kaṅka* must have included the Greater Adjutant Stork, *Leptoptilos dubius*. This large, sad\-looking bird has a black back and wings, a dirty\-white breast, a naked neck and head and a huge yellow wedge\-shaped bill. Hanging from the neck is a long naked red pouch. With its measured gait, the bird is often seen alone or in pairs around garbage dumps in cities and villages or at the edge of lakes, where it eats frogs, fish or large insects. The feathers of cranes and herons were used to make flights for arrows Ja.v.475 M.i.429.

Screw Pine, Hindi *ketaki*, *Pandanus odoratissimus* Ja.iv.482 Ja.vi.269, a many\-branched tree having long spirally\-arranged leaves with toothed edges and a large fruit looking something like a pineapple having a sickly sweet smell when ripe. A fiber is made from the tree and the flower can be eaten. The screw pine usually grows in sandy soil on the coast, or near swamps. A beautiful girl was said to have eyes like the flower of this tree J.iv.482.

Khadira

Hindi *khair*, *Acacia catechu* Ja.ii.162 Ja.iv.528 , a medium\-sized tree with black bark, slender branches covered with hooked thorns and a small white or sometimes pale\-yellow flower. The leaf consists of spine with tiny leaflets on it. The timber of this tree is strong and durable and wood chips are boiled to produce a substance which is added to betel and sometimes used in medicine. We read of bowls and stakes for impaling criminals being made out of *khadira* wood Ja.iv.29 Ja.v.389 and of woodpeckers living in a grove of *khadira* trees Ja.ii.162. The Buddha commented that because of their size and shape, the leaves of neither the *khadira*, the *[palāsa](/define/palāsa)* or the *[āmalaka](/define/āmalaka)* can be made into a container to carry water S.v.438.

Unlike the African varieties, this rhinoceros has thick slate\-gray armor\-like plates on its body and a single horn. This last characteristic, unique amonger animals, is refered to in the refrain of the famous Khaggavisāṇa Sutta is “be alone like the rhinoceros” horn”Sn.35\-75. The rhinoceros was once widely distributed throughout northern India as far as the Indus River delta but is now restricted to small forest reserves in Nepal, West Bengal and Assam.

Date Palm, Hindi *khajur*, *Phoenix dactylifera* Ja.vi.269, a tall stately tree with a bushy crown that produces numerous oblong elliptical reddish\-brown berries with a single seed and a sweet taste, which were a popular food. We read of fowl being prepared for cooking by being smeared with a paste made of white ginger, mustard and sour dates Ja.iii.225. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva once made a living by selling dates Ja.i.296. Although the date palm grows in northern India, it is not common. *Khajjūra* probably refers mainly to the Wild Date Palm, Hindi *khajuri*, *Phoenix sylvestris*. This tree is smaller that the date palm, its fruit has only scanty flesh and it is cultivated mainly for the sweet juice it produces and from which an alcoholic beverage is made Vin.ii.294. The wild date is commonly found around north Indian villages and is easily recognizable by the wedges cut into the top of the trunk from where juice has been extracted. See [Kiṇṇa](/define/Kiṇṇa).

Kikī

Indian Roller, *Coracias benghalensis* J.v.408. About the size of a pigeon, the Indian roller has a large head, a heavy black beak and short legs. The bird is most well\-known for its beautiful blue wings and harsh raucous call. It gets its English name from its spectacular courtship display which involves dramatic somersaulting, darting and nose\-diving. The Pāḷi name is probably an onomatopoeia of the bird’s call. Once the Bodhisattva used the example of the contrasting screech of the beautifully colored roller to teach a beautiful but shrewish queen to speak more pleasantly Ja.ii.350. Popular tradition attributed the roller hen with strong maternal instincts, a belief reflected in a passage from the Jātaka. “The Teacher checks his disciples as a roller inspects her egg, a yak guards her tail, a mother her beloved child or a one\-eyed man his only eye” (Ja.iii.375. See also Vism.36).

Kiṃsuka

Flame of the Forest, also *[palāsa](/define/palāsa)*, Hindi *dhak*, *kimsuk* and *palas*, *Butea frondosa* Ja.ii.265. The Pāḷi name means “thing\-me\-bob.” The *kiṃsuka* is a common, small to medium\-sized tree usually with a blackish crooked trunk, broad leaves shiny on top and velvety underneath and which look greyish from a distance. A profusion of red or orange flowers appear after the leaves fall. The pods are velvety\-brown, about 15 centimeters long and contain flat oval\-shaped seeds. When flowering a blood\-red juice issues from the trunk and branches and hardens into an astringent gum which has medicinal uses. Lac insects are often cultivated on this tree.

Once, a monk asked several of his fellows how insight is attained and each gave him a different answer. Confused, he went and told the Buddha what the other monks had said and the Buddha replied. “Suppose a man who had never seen a *kiṃsuka* tree went and asked another man what such a tree looked like. The other might answer ‘A *kiṃsuka* tree is blackish, like a charred stump’. So for the first man it would appear as the other man sees it. Then he might go to another man and ask him what a *kiṃsuka* tree is like and the other might reply ‘It is reddish, like a piece of meat’. So for him it would appear as the other man sees it. Then he might go to yet another man and ask him what a *kiṃsuka* tree is like and the other might say “Its bark hangs down in strips and its pods burst like a *[sirīsa](/define/sirīsa)* ”. So for him it would appear as the other man sees it. Finally, the man might go to one more person and put his question again and the other might reply “A *kiṃsuka* tree has a thick foliage and gives a close shade like a banyan tree”. So for him it would appear as the other man sees it. In the same way, those advanced men each gave you their answer according to their purified vision” S.iv.193.

We read of the branches of a *kiṃsuka* tree being weighed down with fruit Ja.i.367. According to the Jātaka the Bodhisattva was reborn as a spirit in a flame of the forest tree worshipped by the people of Vārānasi Ja.iii.23.

Kiṇṇa

Yeast, Hindi *kinva*, a fungi of the class Ascomycetes which is used to ferment the sugars in grains and fruits, to raise dough and to produce alcohol Vin.iv.109. Five main types of alcoholic beverages are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka. *Meraya* M.i.238 was distilled alcohol made from sugar or fruit and sometimes flavored with sugar, pepper or the bark of *Gymnema sylvestre*. *Majja* and *surā* Sn.398 Vin.i.205 were brewed from rice or flour but later these names were used generally for any fermented beverage. *Āsava* was also a generic name Ja.iv.222 and later five types were recognized \- that made from flowers, fruit, honey, sugar or a mixture of some or all of these ingredients. The *Arthaṣāstra* gives this recipe for *āsava* \- 10 *palas* of *kapitha* pulp, 500 *palas* of sugar cane juice and 1 *prastha* of honey.

*Jologi* was the juice of the *[khajjūra](/define/khajjūra)* or the wild date palm and the *t**āla* either brewed or distilled. Whether *jologi* could be drunk by monks and nuns even before it had been fermented, was one of the points discussed during the Second Council Vin.ii.294. This debate probably concerned the fact that before palmyra or wild date juice is properly brewed, it spontaneously ferments within a few hours of being tapped, producing approximately 3% alcohol. Other types of alcoholic beverages were *kapotika*Vin.iv.109, *madhu*S.i.212 and *varuni*A.iii.213.

The Jātaka tells a legendary but plausible story of how alcohol was discovered. Long ago in a certain forest there was a fruit tree which had a large forked trunk with a depression in it. Rain water collected in the depression, fruit fell into it and warmed by the sun it fermented. In the summer, thirsty birds drank from the depression, became intoxicated, fell to the ground and after sleeping for a while, flew away. A hunter observed this and curious as to its cause, he too drank some of the liquid and became intoxicated. Later, he introduced this drink to his friends and so it was that alcohol became known. According to the Jātaka, this discovery opened the way for innumerable social ills Ja.v.12\-20. Concerning the consumption of alcohol, the Buddha said: “Whoever follows the Dhamma should not drink or encourage others to do so, knowing that intoxication is the result. Because of intoxication the fool commits evil deeds and makes others negligent too. So avoid this root of wrong, this folly loved only by fools” Sn.398\-9. See [Muddikā](/define/Muddikā).

Wolves attack livestock and have been known to carry off children. Using a proverb similar to the English one, the Jātaka says that some ascetics and priests are “wolves disguised in sheep skins” Ja.v.241.

The male koel is a glossy black with a yellow bill and crimson eyes while the female is brown colored with white spots and bars. Koels are a type of cuckoo and lay their eggs in the nests of other birds Ja.iii.102. During the summer the bird’s pleasant “*koo\-koo\-koo*” call is often heard at dawn. The nun Ambapālī said that when she was a young courtesan her sweet singing was like that of the Asian koel Thi.261.

Silk Worm, also sometimes *kosakimi*, *Bombyx mori* Vin.iii.224. The Pāḷi name means “cocoon maker.”The silk worm constructs a cocoon when it is preparing to enter its chrysalis stage prior to becoming a moth. This cocoon is made from a filament which the caterpillar secretes. Indian silk, called *koseyya*, was different from the Chinese mulberry type A.i.181 A.iv.394. In India, the cocoons were collected from the wild and only after the worms had gnawed through them and thus the thread was not unraveled but carded and then spun into yarn. This meant that the cloth made from it was heavier and rougher than Chinese silk, although still beautiful and much\-sought\-after. To loosen the silk threads, cocoons had to be boiled and silk\-making was a recognized trade Vin.iii.224. The famous brocade of Vārānasi which Prince Siddhattha wore before his renunciation, was made of silk A.i.145. Monks were allowed to have silk robes Vin.i.281 although they were not allowed to have carpets which had silk in them Vin.iii.224. There is a single and late reference in the Tipiṭaka to Chinese silk Bv.24.11. It is also mentioned in the *Nidānakathā* Ja.i.43.

Koñca

Indian Pond Heron, Hindi *konch bak*, *Ardeola grayii*, an earthy brown wading bird with glistening white wings. It is often seen patiently waiting on the edges of rivers and ponds and jabbing at any movement in the water. Its diet consists of small fish, crabs and insects. According to the Jātaka, this bird has a beautiful cry Ja.v.304, which to the Indian ear resembled the trumpeting of an elephant Ja.iv.233 Mil.76. Concequently, one of the words for elephant was *koñca* Vin.iii.109. The Buddha said: “Those who have not lived the holy life, who have not acquired wealth in their youth, pine away like old herons at a pond without fish.” Dhp.155 S.ii.279 Th.1113. There was a curious belief in ancient India that this bird and other herons had the ability to separate milk from water. The Buddha said: “The wise person shuns evil, like a heron that drinks milk and leaves water” Ud.90.

Woodpeckers have short legs for gripping tree trunks and a sharp pointed bill designed for chiseling holes into wood. There are eight species of woodpeckers in northern India although it is not possible to identify any of them from the information given in the Tipiṭaka. Woodpeckers peck at trees until the insects come out and then eat them Ja.ii.162. In a well\-known Jātaka story, a lion with a splinter of bone stuck in its mouth begged a woodpecker to remove it and promised to help the bird in return. The woodpecker removed the splinter but later the selfish ungrateful lion refused to keep its promise. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a woodpecker Ja.ii.162.

Kukkuṭa

The name for both the Domestic Fowl, *Gallus domesticus*, and the Red Jungle Fowl, *Gallus gallus*, the first being the direct and recent ancestor of the second, sometimes also *kukuṭaka* D.iii.202 Ja.vi.538 Vin.iv.62. Domestic chickens were kept for their eggs and meat. Cocks woke people early in the morning and cock fighting was a popular entertainment D.i.6 Ja.i.436. The Buddha said that in the distant future villages would be so close together that a cock would be able to fly from one to the other D.iii.75. A hen might hatch a brood of eight or ten eggs and if she brooded them properly, warmed them properly and turned them properly, the chicks would safely break out of the shell using the claws on their feet and their beaks A.iv.124. When King Milinda expressed doubt to Nāgasena about the Buddha’s statement that the beginning of *saṃsāra* cannot be known, Nāgasena asked him in reply: “As an egg comes from a chicken and a chicken from an egg, is there an end to this series?” Mil.51 This seems to be the earliest use of the well\-known and popular “chicken and egg” dilemma. The male red jungle fowl has glossy rufus and black plumage, a red comb and a long sickle\-shaped tail. It has “wings that flash so gaily and a comb that droops so gracefully” Ja.iii.265. The hen has a light\-brown breast, a dark\-brown back and tail and a mottled neck. A park at Pāṭaliputta called Kukkuṭārāma A.ii.57 gradually evolved into a monastery and was the venue for the Third Council convened by King Asoka.

Common Hoopoe, *Upupa epops* Ja.vi.538. One of the most attractive north Indian birds, the hoopoe has light brown plumage, black and white\-striped wings and tail, a long thin slightly\-curved bill and a fan\-like crest in its head which it opens and closes from time to time, especially when the bird alarmed. It has a gentle musical “*hoo popo*” call repeated sometimes for up to ten minutes at a time. In the Dīgha Nikāya, the hoopoe is mentioned together with several other birds that have pleasant calls D.iii.202. Hoopoes are usually seen singly or in pairs feeding on lawns or in open grassy country.

Probably India’s most common and recognizable bird, sparrows live almost exclusively in towns and villages. The male is a mottled chestnut\-brown with a black throat and a white breast while the slightly smaller female is a lighter chestnut\-brown all over. Sparrows are omnivorous, eating grain, flower buds, grasshoppers and kitchen scraps and make their large untidy nests under the eaves of village houses.

These small crabs burrow holes in the banks of rivers, ponds and paddy fields Ja.iii.293. Crabs are described as having claws, a bony shell, projecting eyes, being hairless and being born in water Ja.iii.295. They make a clicking sound in their holes Ja.ii.376. Village children would sometimes pull crabs out of ponds and kill them with sticks and stones Ja.i.222 Ja.i.389 M.i.234 S.i.123. The commentary to the Vimānavatthu says the Buddha once recommended crab soup as a cure for an ear ache Vv\-a.54. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva once befriended a crab Ja.iii.293.

Marsh Crocodile, also called *[suṃsumāra](/define/suṃsumāra)* or *[susumāra](/define/susumāra)*, *Crocodylus palustris* M.i.459 Thi.241, a large amphibious reptile growing up to 5 meters long that used to live in the Ganges and its tributaries but is now confined to a few game parks. They were considered one of the perils of going down into the water A.ii.123 and were sometimes put in the moats around cities and fortresses Ja.vi.407. We read of a crocodile being harpooned because it was eating fish Ja.ii.227. It was noticed that they sometimes swallow pebbles and grit Mil.67. To “see a crocodile in a drop of water” was a proverb for imagining that there was danger where there was none Ja.i.216. Another proverb with the same meaning was to “see a crocodile in a water pot” Ja.iv.165. When visiting Bhesakalā, the Buddha used to stay at a place called Crocodile Hill A.ii.59. Crocodiles appear in several Jātaka stories where they are usually depicted as crafty dangerous creatures Ja.i.278 Ja.ii.158 Ja.iii.133 Ja.iv.278. See [Gaha](/define/Gaha) and Susuka.

Lyon Bean, Bengali *khamach*, *Mucuna nivea* D.i.76 Ja.iv.352 Vv.80.9, a twining herb with a white flower the seeds and pods of which are edible. Balls or lumps of this grain were eaten for breakfast and it was also probably made into a gruel Ja.iii.405\-6. When the Bodhisattva gave up self\-mortification he regained his strength by eating boiled rice and *kummāsa* M.i.247. When Ven. Raṭṭhapāla returned to his home to beg for alms after having become a monk, his parent, failing to recognize him, refused to give him anything. He saw the household slave about to throw away the remains of the previous evening’s meal of Lyon beans and asked her if she would put it in his bowl. *Kummāsa* was considered a low quality food. The *Chandogya Upaniṣad* mentions villagers eating it after their crops had been destroyed by locusts. M.ii.62. See [Māsa](/define/Māsa).

About the size of a crow, this hawk has a grey back and wings and a white breast with grey and brown streaks. The laggar preys on pigeons, rodents and lizards and used to be trained for hunting. Its call is a high\-pitched prolonged “*whi\-ee\-ee*”. In ancient Indian literature the cry of a woman in distress is often compared to this bird’s call. In Avanti there was a place called the Laggar’s Haunt on the side of a steep mountain A.v.46 S.iii.9.

The Four\-horned Antelope, Tetracerus quadricornis. This small slender animal varies in color from yellowish\-brown to reddish with white underparts. Unique amongst animals the male has four horns, two between the ears and the others smaller ones on the forhead. It prefers open dry forest near water and generally shys away from human habitation and is still relatively common in isolated pockets of forest in northern India and the lowlands of Nepal.

As a penance, ascetics sometimes wore garments made out of *kusa* grass A.i.240 D.i.167 and it was used in the Vedic sacrifice and other Brahminical rituals A.ii.207 A.v.234. *Kusa* grass is used for thatching roofs and making brooms. Fishermen would string their catch on a blade of *kusa* grass It.68. Clumps of *kusa* indicate water below Ja.i.180. There is mention of a type of blue or dark\-colored *kusa* J.iv.140. The Buddha said: “Just as *kusa* grass not properly grasped cuts the hand, so too the monastic life not properly lived leads to purgatory” Dhp.311. Legend says that the Buddha sat at the foot of the Bodhi Tree on *kusa* grass which had been offered to him by a man named Sotthika or Sotthiya Bv.22.25 Ja.i.70. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a spirit in a clump of *kusa* grass Ja.i.441.

Kuṭṭha

<sup>1.</sup> Leprosy, probably also *kilāsa*, Hindi *kush*, a chronic infectious disease caused by the *Mycobacterium leprea* bacillus Ja.vi.196 Ja.vi.383. This pathogen invades the nerves, skin and mucous membranes, causing insensitivity. White or pale patches appear on the skin, particularly on the hands and feet Ja.v.69. In time, the loss of fingers, toes and nose, muscular paralysis and blindness can occur. Mahā Kassapa once ate the food from his bowl even though a finger of a leper who had offered him the food had fallen into it Th.1016. Once a “pathetic, poor, wrenched leper” named Suppabuddha stood at the edge of a crowd listening to the Buddha preach. Noticing this and sensing that he was receptive to the Dhamma, the Buddha modified his talk to suit Suppabuddha’s disposition and level of understanding and he attained enlightenment Ud.48. The Buddha mentioned that lepers would sometimes get maggots in their sores M.i.507.

Kuṭṭha

<sup>2.</sup> Strychnine Tree, Hindi *kuchla*, *Strychnos nux vomica* Ja.iv.530 Ja.vi.537, an evergreen tree with smooth whitish bark, broad elliptic leaves and a greenish\-white flower. It has a globose fruit which becomes yellow to orange when ripe. Strychnine is extracted from the seeds and used in the homeopathic drug Nux vomica.

Kāka

Crow, also called *[apandara](/define/apandara)*, *[bala](/define/bala)*, *[dhanka](/define/dhanka)*, *[kākola](/define/kākola)* “the dark feathered one”, *[vantāda](/define/vantāda)*, “scrap\-eater” and *[vāyasa](/define/vāyasa)*, Hindi *kowa* D.i.9 Ja.ii.439 Ja.iii.274 Ja.v.268 S.i.190 Th.599. Several species of crow live in northern India, the most common being the House Crow, *Corvus splendens* and the Jungle Crow, *Corvus macrorhynchos*, also called *[vanakāka](/define/vanakāka)* in Pāḷi Ja.iii.247. The first is black with a grey neck, mantle and breast while the second is a glossy black all over. Both are alert, aggressive and daring birds that do not hesitate to attack animals much larger than themselves either to rob them or to protect their young. The Buddha said that crows are truculent and pushy, greedy and gluttonous, cruel and pitiless, rough and harsh\-voiced, muddle\-headed and given to hoarding things A.v.149. They are described as making a “*kā kā*” sound Ja.iv.73. One monk was said to have had a voice like a crow Vin.i.115, meaning that it was harsh and unpleasant.

Commenting on the fact that crows are always lean, the Jātaka says: “Their hearts are always agitated and they vex the whole world, therefore crows have no fat on them” Ja.i.486. In one place a crow is described as turning over dry cow patties to eat the insects under them Ja.i.242, and in another we read of an abandoned infant surrounded by crows Vin.i.268. We also read of crows picking out the eyes of an impaled criminal with “their dagger\-like beaks” Ja.i.500. As soon as a devotee leaves a shrine, crows appear and examine the offering for anything edible Ja.v.107. An old man is described as having feet like a crow,perhaps meaning that they were dry and scaly or that the toes were spread J.vi.548.

The crow often featured in the proverbs of the Buddha’s time. Somebody could be “as impudent as a crow” Dhp.244, leftover food was called “a crow’s meal” Ja.ii.149 and a presumptuous boastful person was called a “crow hero” Dhp.244. A boy of seven or eight was said to be “big enough to frighten the crows” Vin.i.79 and to have “the wisdom of a crow” meant making a decision based on greed rather than common sense Ja.v.225. To be helpless was to be “like a crow with its wings clipped” Ja.i.304. A river or pool could be “full enough for a crow to drink from” D.i.244 and crops growing well were “high enough to hide a crow” Ja.ii.174. Crows often appear in the Jātakas where they are usually depicted as cunning, greedy creatures. See [Baḷīyakkha](/define/Baḷīyakkha).

Kāra

Curry Leaf Tree, Hindi *kurry patta*, *Murraya koenigii* Ja.iv.236 Ja.iv.238, a medium\-sized tree with fragrant white flowers and small pointed serrated\-edged leaves. Being very aromatic and having a sharp taste, these leaves are used to flavor food and chewed as an appetizer Ja.vi.24. They are also eaten during famines and by the poor. According to the Jātaka, when the Bodhisattva was an ascetic living in the forest he used to eat curry leaves after having soaked them in water without salt, buttermilk or spices in it, suggesting that that was the usual way to eat them, perhaps as a sort of salad Ja.vi.21.

What is called curry today is a combination of spices powdered and then added to food to flavor it. The Pāḷi word for a curried dish is *sūpa* and is usually used together with a varietycondiments A.iii.48. It is not known what was used to make curry powder at the time of the Buddha, but the essential ingredients of most modern curries are turmeric (*[halidda](/define/halidda)*),black pepper (*[marica](/define/marica)*), cumin ( *[jīraka](/define/jīraka)*), coriander and chilli. Chillies were not known in India until the 16<sup>th</sup> century.

Kīṭa

Insects, sometimes *kīṭaka* M.iii.168 Vin.i.188, Hindi *kit*. Insects are small six\-legged invertebrates of the class Insecta. Some of the different types of insects mentioned by the Buddha include those attracted to the smell of dung, those that live in dark places, others that live in rotting or putrid matter M.iii.168 and still others, *[adhipāta](/define/adhipāta)*, that are attracted to lamps at night Sn.964 Ud.72. Then there were various insects that monks and nuns living in the forest had to learn to endure; *ḍaṃsa*, a biting fly M.i.10 and *[andhaka](/define/andhaka)*, meaning “blind” Sn.20. Three other insects mentioned are the *[cīrilikā](/define/cīrilikā)*, *hiṅgulajalaka* Ja.vi.536 *[paṭanga](/define/paṭanga)* and the *[salabha](/define/salabha)*.

Monks and nuns were expected to examine water before using it to make sure there were no tiny creatures in it, most of which would have been either insects or their larva, that might be injured or killed when the water was used Vin.i.149. The justification for the rule about not traveling during the rainy season was that in doing so a monk might kill some of the insects that proliferate and swarm during that time Vin.136. Scrupulousness towards tiny creatures came to be seen as a sign of the most sensitive compassion as is suggested by Ashvaghosa’s description of the Prince Siddhattha’s reaction to seeing plowing being done. “Clumps of grass turned up by the plow lay scattered on the ground and were covered with tiny dead creatures, insects and worms, and as he saw this he grieved as if one of his own kinsman had been killed” Bc.5.5.

Lasuṇa

Garlic, also *[ativisa](/define/ativisa)*, Hindi *lasun*, *Allium sativum* Vin.iv.34, an onion\-like herb emitting a strong odor, the bulbs of which can be eaten. Because of the strong smell it leaves on the breath which others could find offensive, the Buddha forbade monks eating garlic, although he allowed it to be taken for medicinal purposes Vin.ii.139. Garlic was sometimes also known as *Māgadhaka*, “of Magadha”, perhaps because it was commonly grown in that country Vin.iv.260. Indians have long considered garlic to be detrimental to both physical and spiritual well\-being. The *Manusmṛti* said that a brahmin will lose his caste if he eats garlic. After traveling through India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century, the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang wrote: “Onions and garlic are little grown and few people eat them; if anyone uses them as food they are expelled beyond the walls of the town.”

Medical uses for *Lasuṇa*

Bulb: For fever, pulmonary phthisis, gangrene of lung, whooping cough, rheumatism, duodenal ulcer, hyperlipidemia, certain typhoides, flatulence, atonic dyspepsia, juice on skin diseases and as an ear drop.

Lāpasakuṇa

Quail, sometimes also *[laṭukikā](/define/laṭukikā)* Ja.iii.174 M.i.449. The Pāḷi name means “chattering bird” probably because of the squeaks, whistles and nattering sounds quails exchange when in flocks. Six species of quails are found in northern India, all of them very similar and the most common being the Common Quail, *Coturnix coturnix*. About the same size as a dove, this squat plump little bird has light brown plumage covered with pale yellow\-brown spear\-shaped streaks and mottles, a white band around the front of its neck and above its eyes. Like other quails, it is often seen in pairs or large flocks in grasslands and cultivated fields. Quails could be seen running amongst the clods after the fields had been ploughed Ja.ii.59 S.v.146. They were hunted with nets Ja.i.208 and taken home to be fattened up before being eaten Ja.i.434. Male quails are very pugnacious and setting them to fight each other was a popular entertainment D.i.6. The Buddha said that too much or too little exertion could be detrimental to concentration, just as holding a quail too tightly would kill it or holding it too loosely would allow it to fly through one’s fingers M.iii.159. Once, when the arrogant young brahmin Ambaṭṭha was visiting the Sākyans, he got the distinct impression that they were whispering about and laughing at him. Later he complained of this to the Buddha who defended his kinsmen by saying: “But Ambaṭṭha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes in her own nest” D.i.91. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as an elephant and became leader of a large herd. A quail made her nest in the elephant’s feeding ground and the Bodhisattva stood over it to prevent it being trampled by the other elephants Ja.iii.174. Again according to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a quail Ja.ii.59.

Maccha

Fish, also called *[ambuja](/define/ambuja)* “water born” or *[vārija](/define/vārija)* S.i.52. Fish are aquatic cold\-blooded vertebrates usually covered with scales. Numerous types of fish are found in the rivers and ponds of northern India, many of them edible. However, only a few of those mentioned in the Tipiṭaka can be identified. Fishing was an occupation, although fishermen were despised together with butchers, fowlers, hunters, robbers, murderers, jailers and others “who follow a blood\-soaked work” A.iii.383. There is frequent mention in the Jātakas of fish being eaten, even by ascetics and Brahmans Ja.i.390 Ja.ii.159 Ja.iii.51. Apparently it was often consumed together with alcohol Ja.i.349\-350 Ja.iii.435. Fish were caught in nets, traps, hooked lines or were sometimes speared Ja.i.427, and fish was eaten fresh or dried Ja.i.349. When fishermen caught fish they would throw them onto the sand and later spit them and roast them in hot embers Ja.ii.178. We read of fish in a garden pond coming to be fed at the sound of a drum Ja.ii.227. Fish sense when a drought is coming and try to swim out of their ponds Ja.ii.80.

According to the commentary of the Vimānavatthu, one of the gates of Vārānasi was called the Fisherman’s Gate, probably because it opened on the river where fishermen worked or sold their catch Vv\-a.19. The Buddha compared the way thoughts flit through the mind to the thrashing of a fish when pulled out of the water Dhp.34. Once he scolded some noisy monks, saying that they sounded like fishermen pulling in a good catch A.iii.30. Fish were sometimes used in idioms of the time. A devious person was said to be as unknowable as “the course of fish in the water” Ja.i.295, and to “be tongueless like a fish” meant to be taciturn Ja.vi.295. Sailors who drowned at sea were said to have became “food for the fishes”Ja.v.75.

One Jātaka story mentions a gold\-colored fish Ja.iv.335 which must be a reference to the Golden Barb, *Puntius achsii*. This fish is golden\-colored with silver highlights and has a distinct black spot on the base of its tail. Growing up to 8 cm long the golden barb is found in the standing waters of rivers and in lakes and ponds with silty bottoms where it feeds on small crustaceans and insects. Indian peasants consider the golden barb to be an auspicious creature and it is also a popular aquarium fish. Another type of fish mentioned without being named is one with a human\-body, a razor\-like nose and which leaps in and out of the sea Ja.iv.139. The *Jātakamāla* mentions the same fish and adds that it looks like it is covered with silver armor Jm.xiv.10\-2. Other kinds of fish mentioned include the *aggaraka*, *[āli](/define/āli)*, *kāṇamahamaccha*, *[kālamaccha](/define/kālamaccha)*, *mañjarohita*, *[pāsāṇamacchaka](/define/pāsāṇamacchaka)*, *[satavaṃsa](/define/satavaṃsa)* and the *[savaṃka](/define/savaṃka)* Ja.i.222 Ja.iv.70 Ja.v.405 Ja.vi.278. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a fish Ja.i.331.

The Honey Tree is particularly useful although it is very slow growing and only rarely cultivated. The wood is good and strong, the fleshy corollas of the flower are sun dried and eaten and a sweet spirit can be made from them. It was probably this drink that the Buddha forbade monks and nuns to take Vin.i.246. The unripe fruit is eaten cooked and oil extracted from the seeds is used for cooking and lighting.

Bee, literally “honey maker”, sometimes *madhumakkha*, “honey fly” Ja.iv.265 Ja.vi.506, winged insects belonging to the order Hymenoptera. There are three main species of bee native to northern India, the Rock Bee or *[bhamara](/define/bhamara)* and the Little Bee, which are both wild, and the Indian Hive Bee, *Apis indica*, which is domesticated. Honey was a much sought\-after food. It was eaten with rice Th.23, used as a medicine Vin.iii.77 and sometimes made into mead Vin.iv.109. Lumps of crystallized honey are mentioned Vin.i.219 as are honey cakes A.iii.237, honey balls M.i.114 and wild honey D.iii.87. To find the bees” hives, honey gatherers would tap the trunks of likely trees Ja.iii.200. Bees” wax was used for various purposes and when mixed with oil was applied to the hair Vin.ii.107 Vin.ii.116. Diabetes was known as “honey urine”Vin.iv.8. The Buddha’s first meal after his enlightenment was honey balls and barley gruel offered to him by the merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka Vin.i.3. The Buddha described as “honey\-tongued” the person whose speech is “harmless, pleasing to the ear, agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, pleasant and liked by everybody” A.i.128.

The domestic variety is used to pull plows and carts and for its rich milk. The wild buffalo, *Babalus arnee*, sometimes called *vanamahisa*, “forest buffalo”, is larger and much more aggressive than the domestic variety and is now extinct in northern India Ja.ii.385 Ja.iii.76. Buffalo fights were a popular form of entertainment D.i.6. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a wild buffalo Ja.ii.385.

Mahāmukhamaccha

A type of fish Ja.ii.424. The name means “big\-mouthed fish” and probably refers to the Boal Fish, *Wallago attu*, a species of large catfish commonly found throughout India including in the Ganges and its tributaries. This fish can grow up to 1.5 m long and is known for its huge gaping mouth and voracious appetite. Wading birds, domestic ducks and even dogs have been found in the stomach of this fish.

Makara

This name usually refers to a mythical marine creature with a huge head and mouth and a small body Ja.ii.442. However, there is mention of pins being made out of *makara*”s teeth and a pattern used to decorate buildings and cloth was called “*makara*”s tooth” Vin.ii.113 Vin.ii.117 Vin.ii.152 suggesting that there was actually a fish of this name. If so, it may refer to *Pristis perrotteti*, a species of saw fish. This large fish has a long, broad and flat snout with up to 20 sharp teeth down both edges. Although a marine fish, its strange and fearsome\-looking snouts may have been imported into central India. In the past, the fins of this fish were dried and exported to China, an oil was extracted from the liver and the tough skin was used to make sword scabbards and sandpaper.

Makasa

Mosquito, also *[sūcimukha](/define/sūcimukha)* “needle mouth”, Hindi *machar* A.ii.117 S.i.52 Sn.20, small delicate flying insects belonging to the order Diptera that feed on blood. Numerous species of mosquitoes are found in northern India including nine species of Anopheles mosquito known to carry malaria. Mosquitoes were one of the many things forest\-living monks and nuns had to learn to live with. The monk Gahvaratīriya urged a patient endurance to such biting insects. “Annoyed by flies and mosquitoes in the forest, in the great jungle, be like an elephant in the thick of the battle and endure mindfully”Th.31. The affliction called “snake\-wind\-disease” (*ahivātakaroga*) is thought by some modern scholars to have been malaria Vin.i.77. The Saṃyutta Nikāya mentions a man “whose testicles were like pots” S.ii.258, a common symptom of filariasis. There is also a reference to people suffering from elephantiasis, (*sīpada*, Vin.i.91). Both diseases are caused by *Wuchereria bancrofti*, *Brugia malayi* and several other species of roundworm transmitted by mosquitoes. People protected themselves from mosquitoes by sleeping under nets Vin.ii.119 and protected their flocks from them by lighting smoldering fires Ja.iii.401. Even wild animals kept away from swamps to avoid mosquitoes Ja.iii.401. In the Jātaka there is a story of a man who asked his son to swat a mosquito that had landed on his head. The stupid boy hit the insect with an axe and killed his father Ja.i.247.

Rhesus Macaque, sometimes also *[kapi](/define/kapi)*, Bengali *markat*, Hindi *bandar*, Marathi *makda*, *Macaca mulatta*. This large, aggressive and mischievous primate has a brown coat, a short tail and a bare red and white patch on its rump. When in estrous the females” face goes red. Macaques live in close proximity to humans and are often seen in cities, especially around temples, where they eat flower and food offerings. Commenting on the rapidly changing nature of consciousness the Buddha said:“Just as a macaque moving through the trees grabs one branch and lets it go only to seize another, so too that which is called thought, mind or consciousness arises and disappears continually both day and night” S.ii.9 S.ii.5. The monk Valliya compared the body to a five\-doored house and the mind to a macaque racing around inside it. Then he cried to himself: “Be still, macaque, stop running. Things are not as they were before. Now you are restrained with wisdom”Th.125\-6. Baby macaques were sometimes kept as pets and adults were trained by street entertainers. We read of such an entertainer having a macaque and a snake play together Ja.ii.267. Ascetics would sometimes have cloaks made out of macaque skins Ja.v.235\-6 Interestingly, while the Jātaka says the Bodhisattva was occasionally reborn as other types of monkeys, he was never reborn as a macaque. See [Kapi](/define/Kapi).

Spider, also called *aṭṭhapadā* “eight legs”, and *uṇṇānābhi* “belly spinner”, Hindi *makdi* Ja.ii.147 Ja.iv.538 Ja.v.47. Spiders are insectivorous arthropods of the order Araneae. There are dozens of species of spiders in northern India but not enough information is given in the Tipiṭaka to identify any particular type. In one place we read of dew drops hanging on spiders” webs making it look like a net of pearls Ja.i.120. The Buddha said: “Those infatuated by passion are carried along by a self\-created stream, like a spider following its own web” Dhp.347.

This tree has conical prickles on its trunk and branches, broad trifoliate leaves and beautiful bright red flowers. The flowers appear before the new leaves have grown. It was believed that coral trees grew in heaven Ja.v.143 Ja.v.210 and it was the blossoms from these divine trees that fell from the sky just before the Buddha’s final Nirvāṇa at Kusinārā D.ii.137.

A bird described as eating the figs and uttering the cry “*mayha mayha*” Ja.iii.301. To the ancient Indians this cry sounded like “Mine! Mine!” and in popular imagination the bird was believed to be greedy. It is difficult to identify this bird but it might be the Yellow\-Legged Green Pigeon, *Treron phoenicoptera*. This stout yellow, light\-green and grey bird has a lilac patch on its shoulders and yellow stripes on its black wings. A gregarious bird, it is often found in large numbers in banyan and Bodhi trees trees eating the figs. The famous ornithologist Saleem Ali describes its call as a “pleasant, musical, mellow whistle up and down the scale, with a particular human quality”.

Peafowl, also called *[barihin](/define/barihin)*, *[mora](/define/mora)*, *[sikhandi](/define/sikhandi)* and *[nīlagīva](/define/nīlagīva)*, “the blue\-necked one”, Hindi *birahni* or *morwa*, *Pavo cristatus*, a large ground bird with a distinctive crest and long tail. The male has a beautiful blue\-green neck, breast and tail and chestnut brown wings. Peafowl keep together in small flocks, roost in trees at night and have loud “*may\-aw*” call which can be heard over a long distance. The early morning cry of the “beautiful blue\-necked and crested peacock” would wake sleeping monks Th.22. They are “fair\-crested, fair\-winged, with beautiful blue neck, fair\-faced and have a beautiful song and a fine cry” Th.211. The color of the peacock’s neck was compared with that of beryl Ja.i.207. Fly whisks were made out of peacocks feathers Vv.33.44 and Indian magicians have always used peacock feather fans as their wands. The Buddha compared lay people with the peacock and monks with the goose. The first is beautifully adorned but a clumsy flier, while the second is drab\-colored but can fly with ease Sn.221. In the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha, there was a place where people came to feed the peafowl. The peafowl often appears in the Jātaka stories and the Bodhisattva was reborn as a peacock on several occasions and once as a peahen Ja.ii.33 Ja.iii.126 Ja.iv.333. The *Sāratthappakāsinī* mentions that the people of Magadha had a particular liking for peafowl flesh.

Maṇḍūka

Frog, also sometimes *bheka*, Hindi *manduk* or *bhek* Ja.i.430 Ja.iv.247. Frogs are amphibians of the order Salientia of which about 190 species live in India. Frogs have long hind legs adapted for jumping, large heads with protruding eyes and usually live in or near water. The most common and easily seen frog in northern India is the Skittering Frog, *Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis*. This medium\-sized smooth\-skinned frog is gray, brown or blackish, often with darker spots and a black belly. It is usually seen on the side of ponds and puddles or floating contentedly on the surface. When alarmed, it skitters over the surface, sometimes for a considerable distance, then dives and buries itself in the mud. The skittering frog is seen in all seasons and eats insects and small vertebrates.

We have a description of crows eating frogs in a dried\-up pond Ja.v.106. In his poem in praise of the Ajakaraṇī River, the monk Sappaka mentioned the deep\-throated croaking of the frogs Th.310. When told that people could wash away their sins by bathing in sacred rivers, the nun Puṇṇikā quipped that if this were so then all the turtles, crocodiles and frogs would go to heaven Thi.341. Once, a group of people sat listening to the Buddha preach and a frog, attracted by the sound of his voice, joined the audience. The frog was accidentally crushed by a cowherd’s stick and was afterwards reborn in a heaven realm Vv.51.2. Unripe fruit was said to be “as green as a frog” Ja.vi.529 and snakes were sometimes called “frog eaters” Ja.iii.16. See [Nīlamaṇḍūka](/define/Nīlamaṇḍūka) and [Uddhumāyikā](/define/Uddhumāyikā).

Miga

A word used loosely for wild animals, particularly deer, and especially for the Blackbuck, *Antilope* *cervicapra*. The male blackbuck has a black or dark brown back, white patches around the eyes, a white chin and underside and long spiraling horns. The female, called *[eṇi](/define/eṇi)* or *[hariṇa](/define/hariṇa)*, is similar, only smaller and with a fawn\-colored back and no horns Ja.ii.26. Blackbuck are found in open grassland and light scrub and are now extinct in northern India. A beautiful woman was described as being “doe\-eyed” Ja.v.215 and the Buddha said that those monks who followed his instructions lived happily, unruffled and “with a mind like a blackbuck” M.i.450. Forest\-living monks were often said to be like miga in that they were alert, harmless, wandered freely and retreated deeper into the forest when they encountered people Ja.i.390 Mil.212 Sn.39. The Buddha proclaimed the Dhamma for the first time in a blackbuck reserve called Migadāya near Vārānasi and the pedestals of ancient Indian Buddha images depicting this event often include two blackbuck flanking a Dhamma wheel. A proverb said that a dishonest person is “as twisted as the horn of an *[issā](/define/issā)*” Ja.v.415 Ja.v.425. This would seem to be referring to the blackbuck’s distinctive spiraling horns and thus *[issā](/define/issā)* may be another name for the animal Ja.v.431. During the Islamic period and perhaps earlier, blackbuck were sometimes domesticated and kept as pets and for their meat and milk. In the *Milindapañha*, the blackbuck is included in a list of domestic animals Mil.267. See [Ajina](/define/Ajina) and Eneyya.

Grape Vine, of which there are two species native to India, the Indian Grape, *Vitis indica* and the Fox Grape, *Vitis labrusca* A.v.231 Ja.vi.529 M.iii.127. Both are deciduous woody vines climbing by means of tendrils. The fruit, called grapes, grows in bunches and vary in color from green to blue\-black and can be either tart or sweet. The fruit of the Indian grape is used to make a mediocre wine while the fruit of the second is thick\-skinned and is only rarely used for this purpose. Grapes were eaten fresh or preserved by drying and the juice was extracted from them and made into a refreshing drink Vin.246. Vinegar was made from sour wine Ja.i.242 Ja.ii.394. The Buddha said the essence that the vine absorbs from the earth contributes to the grape’s sweetness A.i.32. The grape vine and its fruit are depicted on the railing of the stūpas at Bharhut and Sanchi.

It was said of someone who could not make clear distinctions that they “could not tell *mugga* from *[māsa](/define/māsa)*” Ja.vi.355. A gruel of sesame, rice and green gram was given as a medicine Vin.201.

Medical uses for *[Tila](/define/Tila)*, *[taṇḍula](/define/taṇḍula)*, *mugga*

(1) Sesame seeds and oil are mixed with other medicines for use as demulcent for urinary problems and dysentery. (2) Rice gruel is taken to relieve poor digestion, diarrhea, dysentery and similar bowel complaints. (3) External and internal uses include remedying of nervous system disorders, rheumatism, paralysis, piles, fever, coughing, and liver diseases.

Muttā

Pearl, small round shiny silvery\-white objects sometimes found in the marine bivalve the Pearl oyster, *Pinctada vulgaris* Ja.iii.437 Ja.iv.120 Ja.vi.489. Pearls were used as jewelry, usually as strings, earrings or nets, and were one of the many precious things coming from the ocean along with gems, beryl, conchs, quartz, coral, gold and silver, rubies and emerald Ud.54. A beautiful woman’s teeth were described as being like pearls Ja.v.204. One of the jobs of the royal assessor was to value the pearls the king wished to buy J.iv.140.A story about the theft of a queen’s pearl necklace by a monkey is one of the more popular Jātaka stories Ja.i.383. According to the *Ganesh Purāṇa*, pearls were harvested in the waters off Sri Lanka, Kathiawad and Tamrilipti and were probably imported from these regions into northern India.

Warriors wore belts made from *muñja* grass to indicate that they were prepared to fight to the death Ja.v.202. When Māra tried to talk Prince Siddhattha out of continuing his quest for enlightenment prince replied: “Look, I wear *muñja* grass”, meaning that he could not be deterred from his quest Sn.440. Today, *muñja* grass is used to make mats, ropes and paper.

Māluvā

Camel’s Foot Creeper, Hindi *malu*, *Bauhinia vahlii*, the largest creeper in the Indian forest Dhp162 S.i.207. This evergreen creeper has soft porous wood, velvety rusty\-colored shoots, paired tendrils and a creamy\-white flower. The leaves, which are sewn together to make plates, are downy beneath and have two rounded lobes on the end giving them the shape of a camel’s footprint and hence the plant’s English name. The big woody pods burst open in the summer heat. The seeds can be eaten and the strong rough fiber in the bark is used to make ropes. Despite its usefulness, the camel’s foot creeper causes great damage to forest trees, twining around them, stunting their growth and sometimes killing them Ja.v.452. It is a fast\-growing plant Dhp.334 and its leaves large enough to be used as plates Ja.v.389. A man described his lover as “clinging to me like a *māluvā* creeper” Ja.v.215. The Buddha said that passions spread the way the *māluvā* creeper spreads through the forest Sn.272.

On another occasion he used this plant in a parable in which he warned that although sense pleasures may give immediate satisfaction, they can cause problems later. “Imagine that in the last month of the summer the pod of a *māluvā* creeper bursts and a seed drop at the foot of a sal tree... Being fertile and not being swallowed by a peacock, eaten by an animal, destroyed by a forest fire, carried away by a forester or destroyed by termites, it was eventually watered by the rains, sprouts and put forth a soft downy shoot which wound around the sal tree. The spirit living in the sal tree thought ‘The touch of this *māluvā* creeper is pleasant.’ But in time the creeper grew around the tree, made a canopy over it and draped a curtain all around it and broke its branches. And then the spirit of the sal tree thought ‘This is the coming danger. Because of this creeper I am now experiencing painful, racking, piercing feelings’ ” M.i.306.

House Mouse, also called *[ākhu](/define/ākhu)*, Hindi *musa*, *Mus musculus*, a small rodent varying in color from brown to grey and with small ears and a tail usually longer than its body. Commonly found in homes, the mouse also lives in fields and scrub. The Buddha said that there are four types of mice; those that dig holes but do not live in them, those that live in holes that they have not dug, those that neither dig holes nor live in them and those that live in the holes they have dug A.ii.104 Ja.137. Mice would sometimes frolic happily in barns S.i.170. Superstitious people believed that it was possible to foretell the future by examining holes chewed in cloth by mice D.i.8. There are numerous species of field mice, dormice and bandicoots found in northern India and the word *mūsikā* may well have been used for some of these also. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a mouse Ja.i.460.

Grey Mongoose, *Herpestes edwardsii*, the most common of the three species of mongoose found in northern India. An alert creature with an elongated body, short legs and tawny grey fur, the mongoose is famous for eating snakes although it also hunts birds, rats and insects. Mongoose were captured and trained to fight snakes for entertainment or to find and kill those that invaded homes. They are a cautious creature and go stealthily when they see humans A.v.289. Indians have long believed that before hunting snakes mongoose eat certain herbs as an antidote against venom. Nāgasena said: “As a mongoose approaches a snake to seize it only after having supplied its own body with medicine, so too the meditator, the earnest student of meditation, on approaching this world abounding as it is in anger and malice, plagued by quarrels, strife, contention and hatred, must anoint his mind with the medicine of love” Mil.394. The medicine mongooses are said to eat as an antidote is the leaves of *Ophiorrhiza mungos*. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva once brought a mongoose and a snake together as friends by teaching them about peace and unity Ja.ii.53 and in another life he became a mongoose trainer Ja.iv.389.

Narada

Spikenard, sometimes also *[maṃsi](/define/maṃsi)*, Hindi *nalab*, *Nardostachys grandiflora* Ja.vi.537 Ja.vi.535, an erect perennial herb with elongated spatulate leaves and a rosy\-pink or sometimes blue flower. The whole plant has a distinct lingering smell but the stout black\-colored rhizome in particular gives off a sweet spicy fragrance. The Buddha referred to the root as *kāḷānusārī* and considered it to be the sweetest of all root fragrances A.v.22 and also to be a useful medicine Vin.i.203. An amber or sometimes greenish oil is extracted from the root by steam distillation. Both the whole root and the oil are widely used in medicines, perfumes and to make incense. Spikenard grows on the southern side of the Himalayas between 3500 and 4500 meters and is usually collected from the wild, although occasionally cultivated. Historical records show that spikenard made its way by trade as far as Egypt in ancient times.

Medical uses for *Narada*

Root: as an aromatic, bitter tonic, stimulant, antiseptic, for convulsions, inhaled (with other plants) for ulcers of nose and palate, dysentery, constipation, bronchitis (with other plants), as a laxative and to improve urination.

Naḷa

A general term for reeds and rushes, grasses that grow in or near water D.iii.75. Numerous types of reeds and rushes grow in northern India but few of them can be identified with the ones mentioned in the Tipiṭaka. A special caste of people harvested certain reeds and rushes D.i.51 S.iii.155. They would cut the stalks, grasp them, shake them up and down, throw them aside and then cut more S.iii.155. After this the stalks would be tied into sheaves S.ii.113. The Buddha said: “By hankering for the future and pining for the past, fools dry up and wither away like a green reed that has been cut” S.i.5. Numerous household articles were made out of reeds and rushes; sandals and stools Vin.iv.39, baskets and mats S.i.5. They were also used to make small huts S.i.156 S.iv.185, to thatch the roofs of houses and in the wattle\-and\-daub construction of walls Ja.iv.318. In the Jātaka, there is a story about merchants who sail to a sea called Nāḷamala which looked like a vast expanse of reeds Ja.iv.140. This almost certainly refers to the Shatt\-al\-arab below the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in Iraq. *[Isikā](/define/Isikā)* D.i.77 M.ii.170, *[kaṭṭaka](/define/kaṭṭaka)* Dhp.164 and *[pabbaja](/define/pabbaja)* Th.27 Th.233 Vin.i.190 S.i.77 were all different types of reeds. *[Santha](/define/Santha)* was a reed or cane used to make bow strings M.i.429 and *[saravana](/define/saravana)* a reed with sharp leaves used to make arrow shafts S.iv.198.

Nigrodha

Banyan Tree, Hindi *nyagrodh*, *Ficus benghalensis*. This large evergreen tree has a red fruit and produces aerial roots which support the ever\-spreading branches, Ja.vi.14 S.i.207. The banyan is famous for growing up against other trees and eventually strangling them. The Jātaka described a bird eating banyan figs, later dropping its excrement in the fork of a flame of the forest tree where the banyan seeds germinated, put forth red shoots and foliage and eventually strangled the tree Ja.iii.208. The Buddha said that craving is like the trunk of the banyan that clings to and eventually envelops the things it comes into contact with S.i.207. He also said that passions come to oneself just as the aerial roots (*khandahaya*) of the banyan are “trunk\-sprung” Sn.272. The figs, which are red and grow on the branches, could be as sweet as sugar Ja.iii.110.

During the Buddha’s stay at Bodh Gaya, he spent seven days sitting at the foot of the Goatherd’s Banyan Tree Ud.3. Once, he compared the kind, generous and believing lay man to a banyan tree. “Just as in some pleasant countryside where four roads meet the great banyan tree is a haven of rest for all the birds; even so the believing lay man is a haven of rest for many, for monks and nuns, for lay men and lay women” A.iii.42. A popular place near Kapilavatthu, the Buddha’s hometown, was the Banyan Park, perhaps named after a large banyan tree that grew there A.v.82. People would make vows before banyan trees, offering them flowers and perfume, watering them and reverently walking around them Ja.i.259 and hence their alternative name “Vow Tree” (*[vararukkha](/define/vararukkha)*, Ja.i.259). One of the 32 characteristics of the Mahāpurisa’s body is that it has the proportions of a banyan tree, i.e. the length of his arm is equal to his height D.ii.18. The previous Buddha Kassapa was enlightened under a banyan tree D.ii.4. Banyan is an English word derived from the Gujarati *banyan*, “a merchant”, Pāḷi *vāṇija*. The first English travelers in India noticed that itinerant merchants would often spread out their wares under the local village banyan tree.

Nimba

Neem Tree, sometimes *[pucimanda](/define/pucimanda)*, Hindi *neem*, *Azadirachta indica* A.i.32 A.v.212 Ja.iv.205, a large deciduous tree the leaves of which have an extremely bitter taste and medicinal and insecticidal properties. It was believed that a mango tree growing next to a neem would give bitter fruit as a result Ja.ii.105. Neem produces a hard durable timber and stakes made from the wood were used to impale criminals Ja.iii.34. An extract from the leaves was used as medicine Vin.i.201.

In India today, country folk use neem twigs to clean their teeth in the morning, chewing the twig until it frays and then rubbing it up and down over their teeth. The Buddha recommended using a tooth stick because it keeps the eyes clear, purifies the sinuses, sweetens the breath, cleans the taste buds, prevents phlegm and mucus getting in the food and makes food more tasty A.iii.249. However, he does not say what type of wood the tooth stick should be made from. See [Tambūla](/define/Tambūla).

Medical uses for *Nimba*

Root: as tonic, antiperiodic, strangulation of intestine. Stems: Bitter astringent, antiperiodic, cholera, vermifuge, demulcent, stimulant, cholera. As a contraceptive, 100 grams of bark from the stem is soaked in 1 liter of water and this infusion is taken by men daily for a month.

Nāga<sup>1</sup>

Iron\-Wood Tree, Hindi *nagkesar*, *Mesua ferrea* Ja.i.35 Ja.i.80, a large evergreen tree with narrow pointed leaves, bright red and shiny when new, and which produces a large fragrant four\-petaled white flower. The flower is referred to as *nāgamāḷika* Ja.vi.269 or *nāgapuppha* Mil.283 and even when dried retains their fragrance. When the iron\-wood tree is in bloom on a Himalayan mountain, and when the gentle breezes are blowing, they waft the fragrance of the flowers for ten or 20 *yojana* Mil.283. According to Hinduism, the arrows of Kāma, the god of sensual love, are tipped with these flowers. The tree gets its English name from the exceptionally hard timber which is used for building.

Nāga<sup>2</sup>

Cobra, Hindi *nag*, large snakes of the family Elapidae which are capable of flattening the long ribs in their necks into a hood when threatened. There are three species of cobra found in northern India. When referring to the cobra the common words for snakes, *āsīvisa* Ja.ii.274, *[sappa](/define/sappa)* Ja.vi.6 and *nāga* Ja.vi.166 are used together with the comment that it has a hood, suggesting that the cobra was also known as “the hooded snake”. Snake charmers were a feature of street life in cities and towns Ja.iii.198 and they usually used cobras because of their impressive appearance, their ability to stand erect and their tendency to follow and therefore appear to dance to the moving flute played by the charmer. These charmers were believed to use special herbs and magic spells to mesmerize cobras in order to attract and then catch them. They would approach the snake, seize it by the tail, drag it backwards so that it would be stretched out full length and then use what was called a “goat’s foot stick” to pin its head down. Seizing it by the head and applying pressure to the sides would force the cobra’s mouth open so the charmer could spit the juice of certain herbs into it which would, it was believed, break its fangs. Over the next few days the cobra would be subjected to a series of procedures meant to pacify it and get it used to being handled. These procedures were called *cuṇṇamāna*, *tantamajjita* and *dussapoṭhima* and seem to have involved wrapping the cobra in cloth and then stretching, squeezing, massaging and striking it. After this the cobra was ready to be used Ja.iv.457. During their performances, charmers would make cobras dance and drape them around their necks Ja.i.370. They would feed them with frogs they had killed Ja.vi.458. The species of cobra favored by charmers has always been the nocturnal Indian Cobra, *Naja naja*, because daylight hampers its ability to strike. See [Kaṇhasappa](/define/Kaṇhasappa) and [Sappa](/define/Sappa).

Nīlamaṇḍūka

Indian Pond Frog, *Eyphlyctis hexadactylus*. This large frog has a flattish snout, smooth skin except on the flanks which are warty and is bright green or olive with a yellow streak extending from the nose to the vent. Pond frogs favor dense aquatic vegetation where they feed on insects, snails and sometimes smaller frogs. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a pond frog Ja.ii.238. The Pāḷi word *nīla* usually means blue but can also mean blue\-green, green or dark\-coloured.

Nīvāra

Wild Rice or Red Rice, *Oryza rufipogon*, probably the same as what was called *[karumbhaka](/define/karumbhaka)*, *sayañjātasālī*, “self\-sown rice” or *[rattasālī](/define/rattasālī)*, “red rice” D.i.166 Ja.iii.247 Ja.v.37 Mil.252. Wild rice is an aggressive hardy aquatic grass very similar to domesticated rice except that it has narrower leaves that are a deeper green and a red kernel. Wild rice is considered a pest because it infests paddy fields, then flowers and sheds its seeds before the harvest, thereby reducing the yield. A gruel consisting of wild rice, *[sāmāka](/define/sāmāka)* and the leaves of some other herbs was given as a cure for bloody diarrhea Ja.iii.144. In the Jātakas, ascetics and animals are said to have eaten wild rice. See [Taṇḍula](/define/Taṇḍula).

Camel, Hindi *oont*, *Camelus dromedarius* Vin.iii.51, a sturdy ungainly animal with a long curving neck and a humped back that thrives in dry and arid habitats. Camels were used for transportation and also for their wool, milk, meat and hides and were probably introduced from Persia centuries before the Buddha. The Buddha said that when practising austerities before his enlightenment, the dry and calloused skin on his buttocks came to resemble a camel’s hoof M.i.245. Pāṇinī mentions bags made out of camel wool and containers made from their leather and intestines. The earliest depictions of camels in Indian art are on the gateway of the great Buddhist stūpa at Sanchi.

Paduma

Sacred Lotus, also known as *[ambuja](/define/ambuja)* “water born”, *bhisa*, *[kamala](/define/kamala)*, *paduminī*, *pokkhara*, *saroruha*, *muḷālipuppha* or *[vārija](/define/vārija)*, “water born”, *Nelumbo necifera* D.i.75 Ja.i.146 S.i.204 Sn.2 Th.1089. The lotus is a perennial aquatic herb with large, round pastel\-green leaves which sometimes float on the surface of the water or rise above it and with prickly stems Sn.845. Lotus blossoms can be pink or white and were named *kokāsaka* or *kumuda* Dhp.285 D.ii.179 and *kokanada* or *[puṇḍarīka](/define/puṇḍarīka)* A.iii.239 S.i.81 respectively. Five hues of white were also discerned Ja.i.281. It seems that the word *paduma* was sometimes used loosely enough to include the Blue Water Lily, *Nymphea caerulra*. This is clear from the fact that the Buddha mentions *paduma* as being white, pink or blue A.i.145. As there is no blue lotus this must refer to the blue water lily, more commonly called *[uppala](/define/uppala)* in Pāḷi.

Lotuses grew in the wild but were also planted in bathing tanks and garden ponds for beautification. When in Campa, the Buddha would stay at one such tank, Gaggarā’s Lotus Lake D.i.111. Such ponds, whether natural or man\-made are described as being full of cool, sweet and clear water and lotus blossoms of different colors S.i.138 Vin.i.5. When still a bodhisattva, the Buddha had three palaces, each with a pond of blue water lilies and pink and white lotuses A.i.145. The lotus has a sweet subtle perfume although it is hard to say whether this comes from the petals, the stem or the pistils S.iii.130. In one delightful story, a monk who waded into a lotus pool to bathe and smell the flowers was chided by a god for being a “smell thief” S.i.204. Comely young men or women were described as having “an excellent lotus\-like beauty” A.iii.90 A.iii.152 and a sincere and generous layman was described as “the lotus of laity” A.iii.206. People would make garlands out of lotus blossoms and also eat the stems and roots Ja.iii.308 and a drink was made from the juice extracted from the root Vin.i.246. Moggallāna is described as collecting lotus roots and stalks to make them into a medicine for fever Vin.i.215. Lotus nectar was also drunk Ja.v.466 and the leaves were used to make holders and to wrap food in S.v.438.

There are several things about the lotus that seem to have fascinated the Buddha and were often mentioned by him. The first was that such a beautiful pure flower emerges from dirty muddy water. To him, this was analogous to the enlightened person’s transcendence of *saṃsāra*. “Just as the lotus is born in the water and grows up beneath the water, yet remains undefiled by the water, fragrant and beautiful. Just so, the Buddha is born in the world, grows up and dwells in the world but like the lotus unstained by the water, he is not defiled by the world” A.iii.346 S.iii.140 Sn.71 Th.700\-1. The second thing was the fact that water will not adhere to the lotus leaf. Because of microscopic waxy papillae on the surface of the leaf water splashed on it turns into quicksilver\-like drops and immediately slips off, leaving no trace of moisture. “Whoever in the world overcomes this low unruly craving, sorrow falls away like drops of water on a lotus leaf” Dhp.336 Dhp.401. See [Sogandhika](/define/Sogandhika).

Medical uses for *Paduma*

Tuber: To relieve strangulation of the intestine. Rhizome: Yields nutritious arrowroot useful for diarrhea and dysentery in children. Carpel: Demulcent. Flower: as astringent and cooling agent for cholera.

Pakkhin

Bird, also *aṇḍajā*, *aṇḍasambhava*, both meaning “egg\-born”, *dija* “twice born”, *pattayāna* “wing goer, *[sakuṇa](/define/sakuṇa)*, *vakkaṅga* ‘going this way and that’, and *vihaṅga* ‘sky travelers’ A.ii.39 D.i.71 Ja.i.121 Ja.i.216 Ja.v.8 Ja.vi.539 S.i.224 S.i.197 Sn.221 Sn.606 Sn.1134 Th.599. Birds are feathered, egg\-laying bipeds of the class Aves. Numerous kinds of birds are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka but not all of these can be identified. However, birds in general are frequently referred to. In the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* birds are classified as either peckers, scratchers, aquatic or birds of prey, although no attempt is made in the Tipiṭaka to classify them. Birds leave no track as they fly through the sky Dhp.92. They flock to big banyan trees to roost, eat the fruit and rest in the shade A.iii.42 A.iii.304. They have beautiful songs; “peacocks scream, herons cry and koels gently warble” D.iii.201. The call of some birds sounded to the Indian ear like words, a point made by the grammarian Yāska. The *jīvaṃjīvaka’s* cry sounded like “Live!” (*Jīva*) and another bird seemed to say “lift up your hearts”(*utthehi citte*, D.iii.201). The monk Rāmaṇeyyaka said that the chirping and twittering of the birds in the forest did not disturb his meditation Th.49. Whether in the forest or at the edge of the village, the bird songs always gave delight. The Jātaka says: “Around and about the trees can be heard the chorus of flocks of *[najjuhā](/define/najjuhā)* birds and cuckoos as they fly from one tree to another. Amongst the branches and foliage they sing to passers\-by and delight both newcomers and locals” Ja.vi.534. It was observed that birds like peacocks and pigeons sometimes eat pebbles or grit Mil.67. Seafarers took birds with them on their voyages and would release them when they sailed out of sight of land. If the bird returned to the ship they would know they were still far from land D.i.222.

The Buddha said that just as a bird flies off taking only its wings with it, monks or nuns should wander taking only a few simple possessions with them D.i.71. A god once told a monk that just as a bird removes dust from itself after a dust bath with a vigorous shake, an ardent mindful monk should flick off the dust of the defilements S.i.197. Birds like domestic fowl, quails and partridges were eaten and “rice with well\-dressed fowl” was a popular dish Sn.241. Feathers were used to make fans and flights for arrows. Peacock feathers were used for decorative purposes, and the quillsof some feathers were used as sewing needles Vin.ii.215 and to store things in. Some ascetics had cloaks made out of the feathers of certain birds. Domestic fowl and their eggs were an important part of people’s diets. Wild birds like quails and pigeons were hunted for food and their eggs were collected. Hawks were trained to hunt Ja.v.275. People put baskets in trees and under eaves for birds to nest in Ja.i.242. Some of the birds mentioned as being protected in King Asoka’s 5<sup>th</sup>Pillar Edict are the *[suka](/define/suka)*, *[sāliya](/define/sāliya)*, *[cakkavāka](/define/cakkavāka)* and the *[haṃsa](/define/haṃsa)*.

The fruit is as large as a pumpkin. When it is ripe it is of a yellowish\-red color. When divided it has in the middle many tens of little fruits of the size of a pigeon’s egg. Breaking these there comes forth a juice of a yellowish\-red color and of delicious flavor. The fruit collects on the tree branches as prolific as the *fuling*.”

Phandana

The Pāḷi name for this tree means “quivering” and it was described by the Buddha as being the most pliable and workable of all trees A.i.9. Its timber was considered suitable for making wheels Ja.iv.209 because its branches would “bend but not break” Ja.iv.209. Along with *[sāla](/define/sāla)* and *[dhava](/define/dhava)* it was the type of tree that people would clear parasitic creepers from, presumably because of its usefulness A.i.202. This may be *Gardenia latifolia*, a small straight tree with thorns on the trunk and branches, elliptic leaves and which is common in dry forests. The wood is close\-grained, very flexible and does not split and in the past was used to make drums, hoops, wheels and circular containers.

Puppha

Flower, also *kusuma*. Flowers are the reproductive structures of Angiosperms, flowering plants. Some of the components of flowers mentioned in the Tipiṭaka include the stem (*daṇḍa* or *vaṇṭa*), buds (*koraka*), petals (*[paṭṭa](/define/paṭṭa)* or *dala*), calyx (*gabbha*), filament (*kiñjakkha*) pericarp (*kaṇṇikā*) and the pollen (*reṇu*). Flowers were said to be of two types, those growing on land and those growing in the water, although sometimes a third type is added; those growing on creepers Ja.i.51 Vv.35.6.

The ancient Indians had a deep appreciation for flowers; they wore them in their hair, as garlands around their necks,used them to flavor their food and drinks and offered them to their gods. Flowers were associated with auspicious events. The Nidānakathā describes how all the plants in the universe burst into flower as the Buddha attained enlightenment. “Flowering trees in the ten thousand world\-systems sprung into bloom and fruit\-bearing trees were weighed down with bunches of fruit. Flowers that blossom on tree trunk, branches and vines did so each in their respective places. Lotuses on stalks broke through the rocky crust and arose in bunches of seven and were heaped together layer upon layer”Ja.i.76. On Uposatha days, Buddhists would abstain from wearing perfume, makeup and garlands A.iv.250. The Buddha said that flowers, incense and colored paste should be offered to shrines D.ii.142 and people were employed to clear flowers from such shrines Ja.v.449 Th.620. A part of the betrothal ceremony consisted of bedecking the bride with garlands M.i.286 and the making of garlands was a recognized craft Ja.v.292. *Kinnara*, mythical creatures with a bird’s body and a human head were believed to dress in flowers, eat pollen and entertain themselves by swinging on creepers Ja.iv.283. The Vinaya mentions a variety of garlands, wreaths and bouquets, although the differences between these are not clear Vin.iii.179. Horticulture was in its infancy, but we do read of royal pleasure gardens surrounded by walls and staffed by guards and gardeners Ja.i.50. Alcoholic drinks were made out of or flavored with certain flowers Ja.iv.117 Vin.i.246 Vin.iv.109. The Buddha often used flowers as similes in his talks and sayings. For example: “Just as many garlands can be made from a heap of flowers, so too many good deeds can be done by one born human.” Dhp.53. “Like a flower that is beautiful but has no scent is the exhortation of one who speaks but does not act accordingly.” Dhp.51 Someone who spoke pleasantly was said to “speak flowers” Pp.29.

An ancient lexicon on the Sanskrit equivalent of this name says “having long hairs around its mouth”. Several hundred species of catfish are found in India including in the Ganges, the Yamuna and their tributaries.

Rukkha

Tree, also *duma*, *jagatāruha* “earth grown”, *pādapa*, “foot drinker” and *viṭapin* A.iii.43 A.ii.43 Bv.9.28 Ja.i.216 Ja.vi.178. Trees are perennial erect plants usually with a single woody stem from which branches bearing leaves extend. The Jātaka says: “It is called a tree because it has branches. Without branches it’s just a stake”Ja.iv.483. The Tipiṭaka mentions many types of trees, and trees in general. Some of the structural components and other parts of trees referred to include the roots (*mūla*), the trunk (*daṇḍa* or *khandha*), the periderm or outer bark (*papaṭikā*), the phloem or inner bark (*taca*), the sapwood (*pheggu*), the heartwood (*[sāra](/define/sāra)*), branches (*sākhā*), twigs (*pasākhā*), leaves (*paṇṇa* or *[paṭṭa](/define/paṭṭa)*) and crown (*agga*, M.i.193\-196).

Roots, those parts of trees and other plants that anchor them and absorb and transport water and nutrients, are discussed in detail in the Tipiṭaka. Some of the different root systems mentioned include large woody roots (*mūla*), tap roots and lateral roots (*mūlāni ahogamāniyāni* *tiriyaṅgamāni*), feeder roots (*nāḷi*), spreading roots (*mūlasantānaka*), hair roots (*mattāni*, S.ii.87\-8 S.iii.155, and in the case of some other plants, tubers (*[āluka](/define/āluka)* or *āluva*, Ja.iv.46) and bulbous roots (*[kanda](/define/kanda)*, D.i.101). The aerial roots of banyan trees were called “trunk\-sprung” (*khandhaja*, Sn.272). It was understood that roots absorb moisture and nutrition from the soil and that the sap (*[ojā](/define/ojā)*) moves upwards through the trunk into the branches and leaves. The *Visuddhimagga* says: “When a great tree is growing on the earth, nourished by the essence of humus and, with that as condition, its roots and trunk, branches and shoots, foliage, flowers and fruit grow so it fills the sky and continues the tree’s species until the end of the aeon, one cannot say that the essence of humus is only found in the roots but not in the trunk or in the fruit but not in the roots, and so on. And why? Because it spreads throughout the whole tree from the roots upwards” Vism.688. The Buddha said: “Just as a tree that has been cut down can grow again if its root is undamaged and complete, in the same way this suffering returns again and again if the tendency to craving is not removed” Dhp.338. However, it was observed that some plants, palm trees in particular, could not grow again if they were “cut off at the root” A.i.137.

There were still large forested tracts in northern India during the Buddha’s time. The Mahāvana or Great Forest, extended almost unbroken from the outskirts of Vesālī to the lower Himalayas. Once, the Buddha stayed in a forest near the village of Pārileyya where an elephant looked after him Ud.42. Other forests visited by the Buddha were the Dark Wood near Sāvatthi S.i.130, the Forest of Offering at Kusinārā A.v.78 the Gosiṅga Forest at Vesālī where many sal trees grew A.v.134 and the Cool Forest to the west of Rājagaha near the city’s charnel ground A.iii.373. Very large and majestic trees were sometimes called *vanaspati*, “forest lords” S.iv.302 Vin.iii.47.

The Buddha encouraged monks and nuns to seek solitary lodgings in the forest A.ii.250, “at the roots of trees, mountain slopes, a glen, a hill cave, a cemetery or a woodland grove” M.iii.3. He said: “The one who wears rag\-robes, who is lean, with protruding veins and who meditates alone in the forest \- him I call a true Brahmin” Dhp.395. Some monks tried living in hollow trees and in the fork of trees Vin.i.152. A forest\-dwelling monk was advised not to settle down at the foot of a tree on a border, one used as a shrine, one from which resin or fruit was collected, one in which flying foxes roost, a hollow tree or one growing in a monastery Vism.74.

However, forests could also be frightening places; they were the abode of dangerous animals and bandits and travelers could get lost in them A.i.153 Ja.i.320 S.i.181 S.iii.108. The Buddha commented that when he lived in the forest before his enlightenment sometimes at night “an animal would prowl around, a peacock would snap a twig or the wind would rustle the leaves” and he would be filled with terror M.i.210. Those entering the forest had to be careful of what fruit they ate as some were poisonous Ja.iii.200. Some forested areas were thorny, unpleasant and difficult to walk through without getting cut or scratched S.iv.189.

Trees, whether wild or cultivated, provided people with many useful products, the main ones being fuel for fire and material for building. People gathered fire wood in forests S.i.180 and the Jātaka says: “Forests are made of (potential) fire wood” Ja.i.289. Once the Buddha met King Pasenadi’s minister of works while he was supervising the cutting of timber in a sal forest S.i.179. The Bhaddasāla Jātaka makes the interesting comment that all the royal palaces in India were supported by numerous columns, some of which must have been wooden. It seems that the king of Benares wanted to construct a magnificent palace supported by a single column and commanded his officers to find a tree trunk big enough for the purpose. They went to the forest and located enough such trees but the state of the roads, they reported to the king, would not allow for the transportation of such a huge log Ja.iv.153.

Fences and kraals were made out of the branches of thorn trees Vin.ii.154. The leaves of certain trees were used to make various household articles like baskets, fans and plates and were used as wrappers for food S.v.438 Ja.vi.510. Parasols could be made out of leaves Ja.iii.79. The seed pods (*sipātikā*) of some trees contained down (*[tūla](/define/tūla)*) which could be used to stuff pillows and pad furniture and saddles.

Another product of trees that a use was found for was the bark (*taca*, *vāka* or *[vakkala](/define/vakkala)*, A.i.152 D.i.167 Ja.ii.13 M.i.198). Household articles like fans and ropes are occasionally mentioned as being made out of bark Ja.iii.204 Vin.ii.130. Ascetics are often described as being dressed in *[vakkala](/define/vakkala)* A.i.240 Ja.ii.274. Although this is usually taken to mean a type of cloth made from bark this may not be the case. More likely it was made out of fibers from the phloem or inner bark of some type of tree or trees. *[Vakkala](/define/Vakkala)* clothing made a rustling noise as the wearer moved Ja.ii.274. The commentary to the Nidānakathā mentions some of the benefits of this unusual type of clothing. It is cheap, it can be made by oneself, it is hard to get dirty and easy to wash, it is easy to mend, it is not difficult to get a new one when the old one is worn out, it is suitable for the ascetic life, thieves do not bother to steal it, it does not beautify the wearer, it is light to wear, it is conducive to contentment, it can be obtained by righteous means and if it is lost it causes no regret Ja.i.9. *[Vakkala](/define/Vakkala)* might have also refered to ordinary cotton or hemp cloth colored with a dye made from the bark of the *[tirīṭa](/define/tirīṭa)* tree D.i.66 M.i.343. There are occasional references to ascetics wearing wood fibers (*darucīraka*), which might be an alternitave name for *[vakkala](/define/vakkala)* Ud.39, or wearing *[phalaka](/define/phalaka)*, which may have been wooden slats or even wood shavings Vin.i.360. These and similar unusual clothing are described as the “characteristic of ascetics of other sects” and were not allowed to be worn by Buddhist monks Vin.i.306.

The Buddha encouraged the planting of fruit trees along roads to offer both shade and food for travelers S.i.33. We read of a man tapping tree trunks with his axe to find hollow ones to use as water pipes A.iv.170 and another doing so to find hollows where bees might be nesting Ja.iii.200. Sometimes as an act of merit, people would repair roads by filling in pot holes, removing large stones and cutting down the trees that might strike the axles of passing chariots and carts Ja.i.199. Certain trees were cultivated for their fruit, flowers, foliage and timber. To grow successfully, a sapling had to have its roots cleared of weeds from time to time, be fertilized with humus (*paṃsu*) and be regularly watered S.ii.89. People believed that spirits lived in medical herbs and trees (*ārāmadevatā*, *rukkhadevatā*, *vanadevatā*, A.iii.369 M.i.307 S.iv.302), particularly very old, gnarled or beautiful ones. These spirits lived in the hollow of trees or in their crowns Ja.i.405 Ja.i.423. Before cutting a tree, a woodsman would inform the tree spirit of his intentions and make offerings to it Ja.i.442 Ja.iv.114. Other trees were worshipped and given offerings because the spirits were believed to grant wishes. Milk and water were poured on the roots, garlands were hung in the branches, lamps of scented oil were burned around them and cloth was tied around their trunks Ja.ii.104. There is the occasional mention of animal and even human sacrifices being made to trees. The victim’s blood was poured around the foot of the tree and the entrails were draped over the branches Ja.i.260 Ja.iii.160. It was believed that trees would give their bounty on condition that they were treated with a degree of respect and the Buddha told a story that illustrates this point. Long ago, the mythical King Koravya had an amazing banyan tree in his realm which bore fruit of exceptional sweetness. Everyone in the realm enjoyed the fruit freely and so there was no reason to guard the tree. But one day a man ate his fill of the fruit then broke a branch and went away. This act of ingratitude so angered the tree spirit that it caused the tree to bear no more fruit A.iii.369\-70.

As with other popular beliefs and superstitions the Buddha did not endorse tree worship. He said: “Gripped by fear people go to sacred mountains, groves, parks and trees. But these are not a safe refuge, not the best refuge. By going there one is not freed from all suffering” Dhp.188\-9. However, the Buddha did respect the beliefs of others and when a certain monk cut down a tree worshipped by local people to make way for a monastery he severly rebuked him for doing so Vin.iii.156.

 Some of the most beautiful passages in Buddhist literature relate to trees. The Buddha said of a kindly hospitable person that he was “like a great banyan tree growing on the side of roads that welcomes weary travelers with its cool shade and soothes their tiredness” Ja.vi.526. The general Buddhist attitude of respect for trees is expressed in these words from the Petavatthu: “Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a branch of it should he break, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer...Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a leaf should he injure, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer” Pv.21.3 Pv.21.5. The *Milindapañha* says that the diligent disciple should try to be like a tree. “As a tree makes no distinction in the shade it gives, like this, the meditator should make no distinction between any beings, but develop love equally to thieves, murderers, enemies and to himself” Mil.410. The *Buddhacarita* compares spiritual practice to a tree “the fibers of which are patience, the flowers virtue, the boughs awareness and wisdom, which is rooted in resolution and which bears the fruit of Dhamma”Bc.13.65. The *Mahāvastu* says: “The meritorious person grows like a banyan tree, while the person of little merit becomes stunted like a tree planted in the roadway” Mv.ii.423. In his *Bodhicariyāvatāra*, the poet Śāntideva wrote of his longing for the peace of the forest life in these words: “The trees do not speak harsh words nor do they try to please by artifice. When shall I have the opportunity to dwell with those happy to live with the trees?”Bcv.viii.26.

A type of insect. The Udāna mentions that one evening as the Buddha sat in the open air he noticed swarms of these insects being attracted to the oil lamp and then falling into it Ud.72. The same habit is said of this creature in Sanskrit literature. This suggests that the *salabha* is a moth. However, the word commentary on the Jātaka and numerous Sanskrit sources, say that swarms of *salabha* sometimes destroy crops Ja.v.401 leading us to think that locusts or grasshoppers are being referred to. During the monsoon in northern India swarms of small grasshoppers, crickets and beetles often join moths in buzzing around any light source. See [Paṭanga](/define/Paṭanga).

Indian Porcupine, Hindi *sayal*, *Hystrix indica* Ja.v.489. A large thickset rodent covered with long black and white striped quills, the porcupine lives in forests and tall grass where it digs burrows and feeds off fruit, tree bark and roots. They also sometimes raid crops. When threatened, the porcupine erects and then rattles its quills as a warning. The porcupine’s name is derived from *salla*, “arrow”, not because its quills resemble arrows but because of the widespread folk belief that it can shoot its quills. Porcupines are one of the animals mentioned in King Asoka’s 5<sup>th</sup> Pillar Edict as being protected.

The flowers only appear when the tree has lost all its leaves. The fragrant golden\-colored and translucent resin that oozes from the trunk has been used as an incense for thousands of years. The leaves of the Indian frankincense are hung up in cow stalls to drive away flies. Real frankincense, which is produced in the southern Arabian Peninsular, was imported into India.

Sappa

Snake, also called *aṇḍaja*, “twice born”, *ahi*, *āsīvisa*, *dijivhā*, “two\-tongued, *[nāga](/define/nāga)*, *pannāga*, *pādūdara*, ‘whose belly is a foot’, *bhogī*, *bhujaga*, *bhujaṅga*, *bhujaṅgama*, *mahoraga*, and *uraga* A.iii.97 Ja.iii.347 M.i.130 S.iii.241 Sn.1604 Th.429. They were also sometimes known as *maṇḍūkabhakkha* ‘frog eater’Ja.iii.16. It is uncertain whether all these words are synonyms or refer to different species of snakes. Snakes are legless, long\-bodied reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. In Jain literature snakes are classified as either with or without a hood, while the Buddha classified them as either venomous and docile, non\-venomous and aggressive, venomous and aggressive or non\-venomous and docile A.ii.110. Snakes shed their skins Sn.1, have forked tongues, long backs, crawl on their bellies Sn.604 and are commonly found living in anthills S.iv.197. The reverence people had for snakes was often mixed with fear and disgust Vin.i.218. The Tipiṭaka contains several accounts of people being bitten by snakes and dying A.ii.70. People wore charms to protect themselves from and to cure snake bites Ja.vi.178. A doctor could give medicine against a snake bite or force the snake to suck the poison out of the wound Ja.i.310. One cure for a snake bite was a concoction of cow dung and urine, ash or clay Vin.i.205.

The Buddha said that one should be careful even of young snakes. “One should not dismiss the snake one might see in village or forest just because it is young. But that snake, fierce, sliding along, with serpentine movements, may attack and bite the foolish man or woman. Therefore, protect your life and avoid that snake” S.i.69. Not everyone tried to avoid snakes. We read of children tormenting a snake, probably a small one, with a stick Ud.11. The Buddha described some species of snakes as being dirty and odorous, terrifying, dangerous and given to betraying their friends A.iii.260. To catch snakes charmers would pin their heads down with a forked stick and then grasp them by the neck M.i.134. The Snake River, Sappinī, at Rājagaha was so named because of its winding serpentine course A.ii.27. It was believed that some snakes were born in the Himalayas from where they migrated down the streams and rivers to the sea and then grew into sea monsters S.v.46. Several types of water snakes are mentioned Ja.ii.238, in particular the *[alagadda](/define/alagadda)* which is described as being venomous M.i.133. The Tipiṭaka mentions a snake with a copper\-colored or red head Ja.vi.194 which can only be the Copper Head, *Elaphe radiata*. This large handsome snake has a copper\-colored or orange head with a black stripe over it and a yellowish\-brown body with three black stripes down the sides. The copper head prefers open country near jungles and undergrowth and is often seen in fields and near villages where it feeds almost exclusively on rodents.The Jātaka correctly points out that the copper head is non\-venomous. See [Agārasappa](/define/Agārasappa), [Ajakara](/define/Ajakara), [Deḍḍubha](/define/Deḍḍubha), [Kaṇhasappa](/define/Kaṇhasappa), [Silābhu](/define/Silābhu) and [Udakasappa](/define/Udakasappa).

Sara

Hindi *sar*, *Saccharum sara* D.i.9 Dhp.304. The Pāḷi name means “arrow”. This grass grows in large tufts up to 5.4 m high and is usually found along river banks although the Buddha commented that it grew thick in forests too D.iii.75. It was used to make ropes, mats and to stuff mattresses Vin.iv.39. The stem of the flower is light, strong and straight and was used as the shafts for arrows.

A deer, probably the Sambar, *Cevus unicolor*, India’s largest and most common deer Ja.iv.267 Ja.vi.537. The sambar has a shaggy brown coat, large spreading antlers and favors deciduous forest and grassland scrub, near water if possible. When alarmed it makes a loud “*donk donk*” call and when pursued by predators. The legs of thrones were made to look like the legs of the sambar Ja.iii.342 and we read of these animals being annoyed by biting insects Ja.iii.401.

Indian Chameleon, Hindi *sarab*, *Chamaeleon zeylandicus.*Growing up to 350 mm long the Indian chameleon has a laterally compressed body, a conical casque on the top of its head and large eyes. Its skin is covered with granular scales and is normally green with yellow and black bands and spots but can change color very quickly when the creature is excited. Indian peasants have a superstitious dread of chameleons, mistakenly believing them to be poisonous. When a monk died of a snake bite, the Buddha taught the others to chant some verses that would protect them from noxious creatures, including chameleons A.ii.73.

Hares have long ears Ja.v.416 and when captured they tremble with fear Dhp.342. To refer to something as a “hare’s horn” meant that it was impossible or absurd Ja.iii.477. To be “as small as a hare’s whisker” was to be insubstantial Ja.iv.233. When the ancient Indians looked at the moon they saw not the face of a human but a hare and a Jātaka story tells how the image of this animal got there Ja.vi.539.

Centipede, Hindi *sata*, *Scolopendra subspinipes* A.ii.73 A.iv.320. Like its English equivalent, the Pāḷi name for this creature means “a hundred legs”. Centipedes are arthropods found throughout India and were one of the many creatures that forest\-living monks had to be careful of. A bite from a centipede could be extremely painful or even fatal A.iii.100. The Buddha mentioned the centipede as an example of a creature that moves stealthily A.v.289. The commentary to the Vinaya mentions monks” robes being the color of a centipede’s back Vv\-a.1083.

It has a rosette of leaves at the end of the branches, the number of leaves in each rosette ranging from five to nine, but most commonly seven and hence the tree’s Pāḷi name, “seven\-leaf”. The famous cave in Rājagaha where the First Buddhist Council was held, took its name from the scholars tree Vin.i.159. In the past, children’s writing boards were made from the wood of this tree which gave it its English name.

Conch, also called *[kumbu](/define/kumbu)*, Hindi *sankh*, *Turbinella pyrum*, a marine mollusk with a particularly thick shell which can be polished to a brilliant white Ja.v.204 Thi.262. Conch shells were considered one of the many precious things found in the ocean along with pearls, gems, beryl, crystal, coral, gold and silver, ruby and emerald Ud.54. During coronation ceremonies water from three conch shells was sprinkled on the monarch’s head Ja.ii.409 Ja.iv.493.They were blown as trumpets and sometimes played together with a small drum Ja.iv.21. The sound of a conch carried far D.i.251. The innermost spiral of the shell could be used as a tube M.i.203 and rings of conch were used as bracelets and anklets. Shells spiraling to the right, which are extremely rare, were considered particularly auspicious Ja.iv.350. To have three wrinkles on the neck like the lines of the spiral on a conch was considered a sign of beauty Ja.v.155 Ja.iv.130. A young man was described as having limbs “as smooth as a conch shell” Ja.v.204. Conch shells are burned and the resulting powder is used as a medicine. According to the *Mahāvastu*, some of the things made out of conch included armlets, vessels for holding oil, perfume and paint, lids, necklaces and girdles Mvu.473. The Buddha described the life of a sincere disciplined monk as being “perfectly clean, perfectly pure and polished like a conch shell” A.v.204 D.i.63. Conchs were harvested mainly in the Palk Straits between the southern tip of India and Sri Lanka, from where they were imported to northern India. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once a conch blower Ja.i.284.

A disease that attacked rice A.iv.279. The name means “white bone”. It is not clear whether this disease was caused by an insect or a fungal or viral pathogen.

If this is correct, *setaṭṭhika* could well be the Rice Stalk Borer, *Chilo suppressalis*. The caterpillar of this small pale\-brown moth bores into the stalk of young rice plants and feeds on the inner pith seriously retarding the plant’s growth. *Setaṭṭhika* was one of the five afflictions that could damage crops Ja.v.401.

The delicate white flowers grow on the surface. *Sevāla* is described as growing on or over rocks Th.1070 and floating on the surface of the water A.iii.186. Geese fed on it Ja.iii.520 Ja.iv.71 and birds could get entangled in it Ja.ii.150. A sect of brahmans from the western India who advocated various purification rituals wore garlands of *sevāla* flowers A.v.263. The name *sevāla* must have been also used loosely for a variety of aquatic plants as there is a comment of it being eaten by sea monsters Ja.v.462. *Sevāla* is sometimes mentioned together with *[paṇaka](/define/paṇaka)* and *[saṅkha](/define/saṅkha)* Vin.iii.177.

Siddhatthaka

White Mustard, *Brassica campestris* Ja.iii.225 Ja.vi.537, an erect stout herb with a blue\-green flower and pods and that yields numerous small round reddish\-brown seeds from which an oil is extracted. A white mustard seed gets a mention in one of the most famous incident in the Buddha’s life. Once a young woman named Kisāgotamī lost her child and mad with grief she ran through the town pleading with people to give her medicine for her child. Eventually she came to the Buddha who gently told her to get a white mustard seed from a house in which no one had ever died. Thinking that this seed would miraculously revive her child she went from house to house asking for one. Everyone was willing to give her one of the tiny seeds but when she asked if anyone had ever died in the house she was always told that someone had. Slowly it dawned on Kisāgotamī that death is an inevitable part of life and her grief gave way to acceptance and understanding Dhp\-a.273.

In ancient India white mustard was widely used as an ingredient in medicines for children’s diseases. It was also a common component in rituals meant to protect children from malevolent influences. This suggests that the storyteller’s choice of a white mustard seed in the Kisāgotamī story was not random or incidental but was used to make the reader initially think that the Buddha was going to cure the child by conventional means.

A medium\-sized dog\-like animal with a scraggy gray\-brown coat, the jackal is both a scavenger and a predator. They could be seen sitting by rivers waiting for fish M.i.335 or prowling up and down the banks looking for prey like tortoises S.iv.177. They would also eat frogs and mice around the threshing floors in harvested fields D.iii.26 and enter cities at night through the sewers to scavenge in the garbage heaps Ja.iii.414. Jackals were often seen in the company of lions and lived on the remains of their prey D.iii.24. The yelp of the jackal cannot be compared with the roar of the lion A.i.187, rather, it was considered pathetic and comical. The Buddha mentioned an old jackal howling at night because it was afflicted by mange S.ii.230. Jackals often feature in the Jātaka stories Ja.i.425 Ja.i.460 Ja.i.491 Ja.ii.6 Ja.ii.354 Ja.iii.113.

Growing up to 1.8 meters in length it is usually found in trees and bushes where it feeds on birds, small mammals and lizards. When first caught the vine snake is very fierce but soon calms down and can be handled with ease. The vine snake is mildly poisonous, although its bite usually has no effect on humans.

The Freshwater Mussel, *Lamellidens marginalis* A.iii.393 D.i.84 M.ii.22, is a bivalve commonly found in rivers, ponds and paddy fields throughout northern India. Its rounded elongated shells are dark\-brown on the outside and pearly\-white on the inside. These shells were used for cleaning, either as scrapers for the skin or ground into an abrasive powder A.i.208 Vin.i.107. The Buddha said that if a man were to look into a pool of clear, still unstirred water he would be able to see mussel shells, pebbles and gravel A.i.9. The shell of the cowrie, a marine mollusk of the family Cypraeidea, is also sometimes mentioned. Cowrie shells are humped with flattened bottoms. The opening of the shell has inrolled lips with tooth\-like ridges on both sides. The underside is usually white, cream or yellow and the top is glossy and usually speckled. Cowrie shells were sometimes used as money Ja.i.426. The vagina was compared to the mouth of the cowrie shell Ja.v.197.

Asian Openbill Stork, *Anastomus oscitians*. This small stork is white or grayish with black wings and orange legs. The mandibles of the reddish\-black bill are slightly arched, creating a gap between them and thus the Pāḷi name meaning “loose mouth”. The openbill stork is commonly found throughout India. Its feathers were used to make flights for arrows M.i.429.

Siṃsapā

Hindi *shisham* or *sissu*, *Dalbergia sissoo*. This large handsome deciduous tree has ovate leaves, their broader ends towards the base and about twice as long as broad. The flowers are small and yellowish. They are widely grown for their fine timber and along roads for shade or on common ground around villages. When in Ālāvi, the Buddha once stayed in the nearby *siṃsapā* grove where he slept on the leaf\-strewn ground A.i.136. There was another such grove at Setavya D.ii.316. Once, while staying in a *siṃsapā* grove near Kosambī, the Buddha gathered up a few leaves and asked the monks: “Which are more numerous, this handful of leaves or those on the trees above?” “The leaves in your hand are few while more are the leaves on the trees” replied the monks. Then the Buddha said: “Likewise, the things I have discovered but not taught are numerous while the things I have taught are few. And why did I not teach all these things? Because they are useless, irrelevant to living the holy life and do not lead to turning away, dispassion, cessation, peace, higher knowledge and Nirvāṇa” S.v.437. Today, the *siṃsapā* is one of India’s main timber trees.

This aquatic plant has rounded leaves that float on the surface of the water and a flower with spear\-shaped pink, yellow but usually white petals and bright yellow stamens. The Tipiṭaka mentions a drink made out of *[sāluka](/define/sāluka)* which the commentary says is the root of water lilies and lotuses Ja.i.563 Vin.i.246. The Bengali name for this plant when pink is *[sāluka](/define/sāluka)*. For reasons which are not clear, one of the purgatorial realms was named after this plant A.v.173 S.i.152.

Soma

The Vedas mention a plant called *soma* from which juice was extracted, mixed with ghee and flour, left to ferment and then drunk during religious ceremonies to produce an intoxicating effect. The *soma* sacrifice was an integral part of Vedic religion and was still being performed at the Buddha’s time, although the drink itself may no longer have been consumed Ja.iv.365 Ja.vi.199.

There has been a great deal of discussion about the identity of the soma plant but a very plausible candidate is Syrian Rue, *Peganum harmala*. This perennial woody herb has bright\-green leaves about 5 cm long and finely divided into long narrow segments, and an attractive white flower with five oblong\-elliptic petals. The leathery seed capsules have three compartments, each containing about 50 dark\-brown angular seeds. The seeds and roots have medicinal and hallucinogenic properties and also yield a red dye. Syrian rue is found in the western and central part of the Ganges valley and grows best in semi\-barren areas.

According to the Jātaka, in two of his former lives the Bodhisattva became so fond of pressing and drinking *soma* and of offering it to the gods that he came to be known as Sutasoma Ja.v.177 Ja.v.457.

Soṇa<sup>1</sup>

Geranium or Camel’s Foot Tree, Hindi *soon*, *Bauhinia purpurea* Ja.i.36, a medium\-sized deciduous tree with large lavender\-colored flowers of great beauty and pleasant fragrance. The shape of the leaves resemble the camel’s hoof and hence the tree’s English name. The previous Buddhas Paduma and Nārada were both enlightened under a great geranium tree Bv.9.22 Bv.10.24.

Soṇa<sup>2</sup>

Domestic Dog, also called *[bhobhukka](/define/bhobhukka)* “bow wow\-maker”, *[katthu](/define/katthu)*, *[kukkura](/define/kukkura)*, *[suṇa](/define/suṇa)*, *[supāṇa](/define/supāṇa)* and *[suvāṇa](/define/suvāṇa)*, *Canis familiaris*. The great diversity in dog breeds is almost entirely due to artificial and selective breeding. With a minimum of human interference dogs are muscular animals with a broad chests, relatively long legs and strong blunt claws. In ancient India dogs were sometimes kept for hunting Ja.v.289, but more commonly to warn of the presence of strangers and to eat household scraps. Generally considered dirty, loathsome creatures, they were never seen as pets but were left to wander through the streets scavenging at the rubbish heaps and eating faeces and the bodies dumped in charnel grounds A.iii.323 M.iii.169. Dogs are mentioned together with chickens, pigs and jackals as animals that eat dung M.iii.168. Unwanted babies were sometimes left out for the jackals and dogs to eat Thi.303. The Buddha said that one of the several unpleasant features of Madhura was the many fierce dogs in the streets A.iii.256. Brahmans would cover the food they were eating with a leaf if a dog stood near to prevent it being rendered impure by the animal’s presence.

We read that when a group of Licchavī youths roaming around in the forest with their weapons and hunting dogs saw the Buddha, they put down their bows and called their dogs to heel A.iii.75. One of the austerities practiced by some ascetics was to behave like a dog \- going naked, licking their hands after eating and curling up on the ground to sleep D.iii.6 M.i.387. Some ascetics would refuse to accept alms if a dog was standing nearby or flies were swarming, probably so as not to deprive them of food A.i.294. In one of his most severe criticisms of brahmins, the Buddha compared them unfavorably with dogs A.iii.220. Outcastes used to eat dogs Thi.509. The various Pāḷi names for the domestic dog were probably also used for the Asiatic Wild Dog, Hindi *dhol*, *Cuon alpinus*, a reddish brown forest\-living canine with shorter legs and a more bushy tail than the domestic dog. Wild dogs hunt in packs and communicate with each other by a whistling sound. The Asiatic wild dog is now extinct in northern India and increasingly rare in other parts of the sub\-continent. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a dog Ja.i.175.

This beautiful bird has bright green plumage, a large red beak, a red patch on its wing and a pink band on the back of its neck turning black towards the front. Like most Indian parrots, it has a red beak Ja.iv.434. Flocks of these lively noisy birds descend on crops and orchards where they do great damage. People kept parrots as pets and fed them on parched grain and honey Ja.iii.97. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as a parrot Ja.ii.132 Ja.ii.292 Ja.iii.97 Ja.iii.491.

Sumanā

The name jasmine is used loosely for a wide variety of sometimes unrelated plants that produce small white star\-shaped flowers with a particularly fragrant perfume. Most plants popurlary called jasmine are of the family Oleaceae, genus Jasminum. The Pāḷi names *[jātisumanā](/define/jātisumanā)* Ja.v.420, *[mallikā](/define/mallikā)* A.i.226 Dhp.54, *sumanā* Ja.v.402 Ja.vi.440 Ja.vi.537 Th.96, *[vassikā](/define/vassikā)*, *vassikī* and *[yūthikā](/define/yūthikā)* are usually translated as jasmine. There at least a dozen plants of the genus Jasminum that grow in northern India, the most common being *Jasminum sambac*, *J. pubescens*, *J. scandens*, *J. arborescens*, *J. strictum*, *J. caudatum* and *J. flexile*. All these plants are low shrubs with woody stems that have a tendency to climb and have small simple or pinnate leaves. They all produce small, usually white but sometimes pink or yellow flowers. All grow wild although several are also cultivated. In the case of *J. sambac*, an essential oil is extracted from the flower and is used in incense and perfume. The *[mallikā](/define/mallikā)* was considered the most fragrant of all flowers S.iii.157. There is a reference to cloth with a *sumanā* flower pattern printed or embroidered on it Ja.i.62 and the Buddha asked his disciples to imitate the *[vassikā](/define/vassikā)*. “Just as the jasmine sheds its withered flowers, so you, oh monks, should shed desire and hatred”Dhp.377.

The Ganges dolphin is a large cetacean varying in color from slate\-blue to muddy brown and with a long thin beak bearing a row of sharp interlocking teeth. The mouth curves upward at the end making it look as if the animal is smiling. This dolphin is found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra and their tributaries. Dolphins were hunted for their flesh and the oil rendered from their fat was used as a medicine. The Ganges dolphin is now critically endangered.

Uncertain, but probably used loosely for crocodiles, gharials, the Ganges dolphin and sea monsters A.ii.123. The word may also have been used for the two species of sharks found in the larger rivers of northern India. The Ganges Shark, *Glyphis gangeticus*, has a rounded head, small eyes and ranges in colour from grey to greyish\-brown. Although it only eats fish and carrion, its size and appearance may have led to the belief that it was dangerous to humans M.i.459. The Ganges shark is now critically endangered. The Bull Shark, *Carcharhinus leucas*, definitely attacks humans and although mainly a marine creature it has been seen up the Ganges as far as Patna. *Susukā* tallow was used as medicine Vin.i.200.

Indian Teak, Hindi *sagwan*, *Tectona grandis*, a large tree growing up to 46 meters in height and with a straight often buttressed trunk, a spreading crown, large elliptic leaves and white flowers. The yellow to brown heartwood is easily worked, resistant to decay and retains its fragrance for years. This wood was considered to be superior to all others M.ii.129. The Indian teak is now rare in the wild but is often grown in plantations. There was a legend that the Sākyans, the tribe the Buddha came from, derived their name from this tree. The Buddha once related this legend to Ambaṭṭha. “In days of old, so say those who remember their family lineage...King Okkāka who loved his queen and wished to transfer the kingdom to his son by her, banished his earlier sons, Okkāmukha, Karaṇḍu, Hatthinīya and Sīnipura. Being thus banished, they settled at the foot of the Himalayan foothills beside a lotus pond where there was a *sāka* forest. Not wanting to degrade their lineage, they cohabited with their own sisters. King Okkāka asked his ministers and advisers: ‘Where are they living now?’ and when they told him he said: ‘They are strong as *sākas*, they are real Sākyans! ’ and this is how the Sākyans got their well\-known name” D.i.92.

Sāla

Sal, *Shorea robusta*, also sometimes called *[assakaṇṇa](/define/assakaṇṇa)* because the long spatula\-shaped sepals enclosing the flower resemble a horses ear Ja.vi.528. The sal is a majestic tree growing up to 45 meters in height and having a girth of 3.6 meters, with ovate oblong leaves and pale yellow flowers. The sal and its flower are often referred to in the Tipiṭaka Th.948. It has dark green leaves, a straight trunk and is beautiful to see Ja.v.251. The huge sal trees that grew in the lower reaches of the Himalayas are described as having leaves and foliage, bark and shoots, soft wood and heart wood D.iii.152.

The Tipiṭaka describes how a man would make a boat out of a sal trunk. First he would locate a large tree in the forest and cut it down with his ax. After shaping the exterior and hollowing out the inside, he would then further shape it with a scraper and then smooth it with a rock ball. Finally, he would fix a rudder, make a pair of oars and then slide it down to the river A.ii.201. The Buddha describes a man going to a sal forest near a village and cutting down the other trees and the crooked sal saplings so that the already well\-established sal trees would grow bigger and straighter M.i.125. Sal trees were sometimes strangled by parasitic vines Dhp.162 Ja.v.452.

The Rukkhadhamma Jātaka uses the thickness of a sal forest to illustrate the advantages of unity. King Vessavaṇa asked all the tree spirits to select for themselves a plant as their home. The Bodhisattva, who had been reborn as a tree spirit, advised his kinsmen to avoid trees that stood alone and pick those that grew close to others. Some did as he advised, making their homes in a thick sal forest, but others moved into isolated trees growing near towns and villages thinking that they would receive offerings humans made to such trees. One day a mighty storm swept over the country uprooting even the mightiest and most deeply rooted trees growing in the open. But the sal trees in the forest, supported by each other and with their branches interlaced withstood the storm Ja.i.328\-9.

When the Buddha arrived in Kusinārā on his last tour and lay down between two sal trees, they burst into flower out of season and sprinkled their petals over him. When Ānanda expressed amazement that the very trees were revering him, the Buddha said: “Ānanda, these sal trees burst into flower out of season in homage to the Tathāgata and covered his body \- but the monk or the nun, the lay man or the lay woman who lives practicing the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfills the Dhamma, they honors, reveres and respects the Tathāgata with the highest homage” D.ii.137\-8. In the light of this story and the traditional belief that the Buddha passed away during Vesākha, it is interesting to note that the sal usually blossoms in March\-April and occasionally in May. The Buddha once said that his Dhamma was so convincing that if the great sal trees had consciousness and could comprehend, even they would benefit from it A.ii.193.

One moonlit night, Ānanda and Revata went to visit Sāriputta at the sal forest of Gosinga which was “delightful \- with all the trees in full bloom and with a heavenly fragrance wafting through the air” M.i.212. Sometimes gruel was made from or flavored with sal flowers or perhaps its resin A.iii.49. The sal was and continues to be even today an important source of timber in India. Oil distilled from the seeds is used for lamps and the resin which exudes naturally or is sometimes tapped is used as a medicine, to make incense and also a perfume called *dammar* in Hindi. Sal butter, which is extracted from the seeds, is used as substitute for cocoa in the manufacture of chocolate. The past Buddha Vessabhū attained enlightenment under a *mahāsāla*D.ii.4 which probably refers to a particularly large individual tree.

Sāliya

Common Hill Myna, sometimes *sāḷikā*, or *sāliyāya*, *Gracula religiosa* Ja.i.429 Ja.vi.421 Ja.vi.425. The Pāḷi means “rice bird” although called *pahari myna* in Hindi and Bengali most other species of myna are called *salik* in those languages. The hill myna has glossy\-black plumage with white patches on the wings, bright yellow patches of skin, wattles below its eyes and yellow beak and legs. It lives mainly in the hills that border the northern edge of the Ganges valley and feeds on fruit. It has a loud although not unpleasant warbling creaking song and is very good at imitating human speech D.iii.202 which even today makes it a popular cage bird. Vaṅgīsa said that the Buddha’s voice was sweet like that of the myna Th.1232, and Sāriputta’s voice was described similarly S.i.190. Teaching mynas and parrots to speak is mentioned in the *Kāma Sūtra* as a pleasant pastime. According to the charming Tesakuṇa Jātaka, Ānanda was reborn as a myna and together with an owl and a parrot, instructed a king on how to be a good and just ruler Ja.v.110.

Asiatic Lion, also *migābhibhū*, “the king of creatures” and *migarāja*, “the king of the beasts”, Hindi *singh*, *Panthera leo persica* D.iii.23 Ja.ii.244 Sn.684. The Asiatic lion is a large stately tawny\-colored cat with a long tail with a tuft at the end. It differs slightly from its African cousin, being smaller and having a fringe of hair down its abdomen and in the males a less luxuriant mane. The lion’s preferred habitat is dry jungle and open grassland where they hunt deer and sometimes domestic cattle.

The Buddha said that of all animals the lion is the best in respect to strength, speed and courage S.v.227. They were said to be “five\-pawed”(*pañcahattha*), the mouth being the fifth “paw” Ja.v.425. Being a noble creature, they always lie on their right sides, with one paw on the other and with their tails between their thighs A.ii.245. The male lion emerges from its lair in the evening, stretches, looks around, roars three times and then goes in search of prey A.ii.32.When other animals hear the lion’s roar they are frightened. “Those who live in burrows descend into them, aquatic animals take to the water, forest dwellers make for the forest and birds take to the air” A.ii.33. When the lion strikes at its prey, whether it be an elephant, buffalo, ox, leopard, hare or cat, it does so with great skill A.iii.121.

In one place we read of monks finding and eating the remains of a lion’s prey Vin.iii.57 and of monks being attacked and killed by lions. Lions are often accompanied by jackals. A preparation called lion oil was considered very valuable, but it is uncertain whether it was given this name because of its supposed potency or because it was actually made from lion tallow Ja.i.98 Ja.v.149. There was a market for lion’s hides, claws, teeth and fat Ja.i.388. Sīha (Sanskrit Siṃgha) has long been a popular name in India. One of the Buddha’s disciples, a general, was named Sīha A.iii.38 as were several monks D.i.151 Th.83. The Buddha himself said: “Lion, monks, is a name for the Tathāgata, the Arahat, the Fully Enlightened one” A.iii.121. When he lay down to rest or to sleep, the Buddha always did so in the “lion posture”, i.e. on his right side, with one foot on the other, mindful and fully aware S.i.27 S.i.106. His bold and confident claim to be enlightened was called his “lion’s roar” A.ii.10. Two of the 32 special characteristics of the Mahāpurisa are that the front of his body is like that of the lion and his jaw like a lion’s D.ii.18. Lions often feature in the Jātakas where they are depicted as either noble or fearsome creatures, but also sometimes as foolish or mean\-spirited.

Even in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century Asiatic lions were still found in the less populated parts of the Middle East and northern India but today the last 300 or so are restricted to the Gir Forest in Gujarat. See [Kālasīha](/define/Kālasīha) and [Kesarī](/define/Kesarī).

Sūkara

Domestic Pig, also called *[varāha](/define/varāha)*, Hindi *sukar*, *Sus scrofa*. Whether wild or domesticated, pigs are a stout, cloven\-hoofed mammals of the order Suidae. The Indian pig is usually small, dark\-gray and covered with bristles. Today they are rarely eaten but are kept to eat rubbish and human faeces around villages M.iii.168. They were fed dried cow dung D.ii.347 M.iii.168. In his last meal before he passed away the Buddha ate a dish called *sūkaramaddava*, “pig’s delight”, but it is not known whether this contained pork D.ii.127. Whatever it was, *sūkaramaddava* served with *[badara](/define/badara)* fruit was considered a sumptuous dish A.iii.48. The Buddha once compared the indolent person to a pig. “When one is lazy and gluttonous, snoozing and rolling around on the bed like a great pig, he will be reborn again and again” Dhp.325.

The wild pig, Hindi *jangli sukar*, is larger, more hairy and more aggressive than its domestic cousin and males have a thick black manes. Wild pigs live in jungles and grasslands and are omnivorous. Both the domestic and the wild pig are occasionally mentioned in the Jātaka and once the Bodhisattva was reborn as a pig Ja.iii.286.

Taṇḍula

The seed of the Rice Plant, Hindi *tandul*, *Oryza sativa*, a type of swamp grass, the seeds of which are edible. Rice was the main food crop in northern India during the Buddha’s time. There are thought to be as many as 200,000 varieties of rice in India today. The *Śhunya Purāṇa* mentions 50 varieties while the Tipiṭaka mentions about nine, although only one of them can be identified with those known today. *[Daddula](/define/Daddula)* was an inferior type A.i.241 D.i.5 M.i.78 M.i.156 while *[nīvāra](/define/nīvāra)* was, according to Pāṇinī, a low quality wild rice D.i.166. *[Pavīhi](/define/Pavīhi)* J.v.405 and *[vīhi](/define/vīhi)* Th.381 were common varieties while *[sāli](/define/sāli)* was considered the best type A.i.8 A.i.32 A.i.145 A.iii.49 A.iv.231 D.i.105 Ja.i.327 This last type was probably an earlier variety of the famous *mahāsāli* often praised in ancient sources. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang was given this rice when he was in India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century. He wrote: “This rice is as large as a black bean and when cooked is aromatic and shining, like no other type of rice. It grows in Magadha and nowhere else.” According to Pāṇinī, *[sāli](/define/sāli)* was grown in the winter and *[vīhi](/define/vīhi)* in the summer. The whiter the grains of *[sāli](/define/sāli)*, the finer it was considered to be Ja.vi.516. The rich ate *[sāli](/define/sāli)* and meat but fed their slaves and servants broken rice and sour gruel A.i.145. *[Sāliyavaka](/define/Sāliyavaka)* Ja.iv.172 was, according to both Pāṇinī and the *Carakasaṃhitā*, the name of a variety of rice. Wild or self\-cultivated rice, *sayañjātasāli*, is also sometimes mentioned Ja.i.325. One wild variety was called *[sūkarasāli](/define/sūkarasāli)*, pig’s rice Ja.vi.531. Being the main staple in northern India, the Tipiṭaka contains much information about the cultivation of rice. Paddy fields were square or rectangular and had embankments around them Ja.iv.167 Vin.i.391. A good paddy field had to be level, have deep fertile soil, a reliable water supply, an inlet and outlet for the water and sturdy embankments around it A.iv.237. There is mention of ponds or lakes, either natural or man\-made, being near paddy fields or of them being situated near rivers A.iii.26 Ja.iii.293 Ja.iv.167 Ja.v.35, and we read of hollow tree trunks being used as irrigation pipes A.iv.170. Farmers would indicate which fields were theirs with marker stones Ja.iv.281. To get a good yield the seed had to be unbroken, capable of sprouting and then well\-watered A.i.135. It was believed that rice seeds would absorb the essence of the earth and water and that this would determine its taste A.v.212. Few of the implements used in agriculture, including rice cultivation, are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka, amongst them the plough (*naṅgola*) with its iron\-tipped plough share (*phālapācana*), the hoe or spade (*kuḍḍāla*), the sickle (*tiṇalāyana asi*) and a tool sometimes translated as a weeding hook (*niddāna*, A.i.204 Ja.v.45 Sn.77\-8). A ceremony called *vappamaṅgala* was conducted just before the first plowing in the belief that it would guarantee a good harvest Ja.i.57 Ja.iv.167.

The growing rice had to be protected from cattle straying into it and from wild birds and animals eating it. The ripening crop was sometimes attacked by a disease called *[setaṭṭhika](/define/setaṭṭhika)* A.iv.278. The process of harvesting consisted of reaping the rice, gathering it up, tying it into sheaves to dry, treading it out, winnowing it and then threshing it A.i.241. The grains were loosened from the stalks by driving cattle over it Th.1 or by beating it out with flails S.iv.201. The winnowing was done by dropping the grain from a height and allowing the wind to separate the grain from the chaff. The harvesters would take care to keep the grain and the chaff separate and use a broom to sweep them apart A.iv.169. Alternatively, sometimes winnowing baskets shaped like an elephants” ear were used to fan the grain from the chaff and then to remove grit Ud.68. After the harvest the rice was stored in a granary Vin.i.240 and every now and then it would be taken out to be aired Vin.i.211.

 Plain boiled rice was called *odana* or *bhatta* and was usually eaten with various curries and condiments A.iv.230. The rich would have the blackened grains removed from their rice A.iv.230 while the poor might be reduced to eating even the scum formed by cooking rice A.i.241 Ja.ii.289. Bran, (*[kaṇa](/define/kaṇa)*, *[kukkusa](/define/kukkusa)* or *kuṇḍaka*), the brown covering of grains removed during polishing or milling, was considered the most humble of foods and was made into cakes and gruel D.i.166 Ja.i.423. People considered milled and polished white rice to be superior to unmilled brown rice. A guest in the Jātaka noticed that at the beginning of his stay his host served him white rice but as time progressed it became brown, indicating that he had outstayed his welcome Ja.v.233.

Rice was sometimes cooked together with sesame seeds Ja.iii.425. *Kaṇājaka* was a porridge made from the broken grains that had been removed while cleaning the rice Ja.v.230. A porridge of rice boiled in milk was called *khīrodana* Vv.33.24 or *pāyāsa* Ja.iv.391 S.i.166. An idiom said that a loving couple were as inseparable as ghee mixed into *pāyāsa*, which must have been another way of serving this porridge Ja.i.457.A feature of various auspicious occasions was to scatter grains of popped rice (*lajja*) together with flower petals of different colors Ja.ii.240 Ja.vi.42. A confectionary called *madulāja* was madeof balls of popped rice held together with molassesJa.iii.539 Ja.iv.214. A gruel called *yāgu* A.iii.50 D.i.76 M.i.247 was probably made as it is today by boiling rice in water to a thin consistency and adding salt, a garlic clove and a few pepper corns. The Buddha said there were five benefits of this rice gruel; it dispels hunger, quenches thirst, regulates wind, cleanses the bowels and it helps digest the remnants of food A.iii.249. Another type of gruel was called *bilanga* Vin.ii.77. A type of alcoholic beverage was prepared from cooked rice with yeast added Vin.iv.109. A preparation called *thālīpāka* was made, according to the *Gūhya Sūtra*, of either rice or barley cooked with either milk or water and was used as an offering to the gods. After being offered this food was eaten A.i.166 D.i.97 S.ii.242.

The Nidānakathā gives the recipe for a rice dish called *gavapāna*. To make it, one boiled milk until it thickened, added rice a little at a time, then added a cooked mixture of honey, palm sugar, flour and ghee and then let it simmer until the rice was soft Ja.i.33. In several places in the Tipiṭaka women are dismissed as having a “two\-fingered wit” S.i.129. According to the commentary, this refers to the housewives” habit of squeezing grains of boiling rice between the thumb and first finger to see if it is cooked. See [Pasādiyā](/define/Pasādiyā).

Medical uses for *[Tila](/define/Tila)*, *taṇḍula*, *[mugga](/define/mugga)*

(1) Sesame seeds and oil are mixed with other medicines for use as demulcent for urinary problems and dysentery. (2) Rice gruel is taken to relieve poor digestion, diarrhea, dysentery and similar bowel complaints. (3) External and internal uses include remedying of nervous system disorders, rheumatism, paralysis, piles, fever, coughing, and liver diseases.

Sesame was considered an essential food along with rice, beans, cereals, butter, sugar and salt A.iv.107. Before being stored, sesame seeds were washed and dried in the sun Vv\-a.10. Rice was cooked with sesame J.iii.425, the seeds were ground into a paste Vin.i.205 or made into cakes Vv\-a.33 and the oil was drunk or used in cooking. A gruel of sesame, rice and Green Gram was given as a medicine Vin.i.201. When the Bodhisattva was practicing austerities one of the things he ate was *piññāka*, the pulp left after the oil had been extracted from sesame seeds M.i.78. Sesame fields could be struck with a blight leaving the plants with only one or two leaves on them S.i.170. Oil from sesame and other seeds was extracted in a mill consisting of a large stone wheel that creaked as it turned A.168 Bv.2.168. To extract the oil, sesame meal would be sprinkled with water and then pressed M.iii.142. A pimple or freckle was called *[tilakā](/define/tilakā)* for its resemblance to a sesame seed M.i.88 S.i.170. Some monks once asked the Buddha how long the lifespan of beings in the Paduma Purgatory was. He replied: “Imagine a Kosalan cart filled with twenty measures of sesame seeds and imagine that once every century one seed was removed from it. That cart would be empty sooner than the time in purgatory would be over.” A.v.173.

The fruit, which is globose and slightly oblong and with a conical tip, is greenish\-yellow, gradually turning black. Probably repeating a common comparison, the Buddha observed that the breasts of young women are like the *timbaru* fruit Sn.110. We read of a woman winding a ball of cotton yarn on a *timbaru* pip Ja.vi.336.

Seventeen species of whales and also the dugong swim in Indian waters and are occasionally washed up on beaches. It was probably reports of such creatures by fishermen and seafarers that gave rise to stories about sea monsters. It was said of these creatures that they were huge and that they “draw in and blow out great gulps of water” Mil.262. The Tamil, Telegu and Malayalam word for whale is *thimingilam* and the Kannada word is *thimingila*. See [Susukā](/define/Susukā).

Tittakalābu

Bitter Gourd, *Mamordica charantia*, a common slender climber covered with velvety hairs and with a yellow flower. The fruit is long and thin, ribbed, tapering to a point at both ends and yellow when ripe. It is also extremely bitter but is eaten in the belief that it is good for the health. The Buddha mentioned the seeds of this plant along with those of the *[nimba](/define/nimba)* and the *[kosātakī](/define/kosātakī)* as being very bitter A.i.31. He said that the doctrines of some of the other teachers of the time were like a concoction of bitter gourd and poison, unpleasant now and with unpleasant consequences later M.i.315. He also mentioned that when he was practicing austerities before his enlightenment he became so emaciated that his scalp looked like a bitter gourd withered by the sun M.i.80.

Tiṇa

Grass, also *[saddala](/define/saddala)* A.i.145 D.ii.19. Grasses are variable and widespread plants of the family Gramineae. More than a dozen species of grass are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka. The Buddha said that a monk or nun should not steal anything, not even a blade of grass Vin.i.97. Various useful items were made out of grass. We read of grass mats Vin.i.286 and of houses being thatched with grass A.i.101. Growing amongst the crops, grass becomes a weed and a curse Dhp.358. There is mention of whole jungles of grass A.i.153 S.ii.152 which sometimes caught fire so that many creatures died S.ii.151. This probably refers to the Terai\-Duar grasslands ecoregion on the northern edge of the Ganges Valley. The Buddha required his monks and nuns to stay put during the monsoon so that they would not tread down crops and grass and injure the tiny creatures that lived among them Vin.i.137 The Buddha mentioned that on retiring to the forest for meditation he would gather grass and leaves for a seat to sit on. A.i.182. On one occasion a Brahman had prepeared a bed of grass for the Buddha to sleep on in his fire hall. When the ascetic Māgandiya saw this he commented disapprovingly to the Brahman: “It is a sorry sight indeed when we see the bed of the Master Gotama, that destroyer or growth” M.i.502. Perhaps Māgandika belonged to a sect that considered even cutting plants to qualify as killing.

Several of species of grass mentioned in the Tipiṭaka which cannot be identified include *[jantu](/define/jantu)* a pale\-colored grass Vin.i.196, *[poṭakila](/define/poṭakila)* a soft grass Ja.vi.508 Th.27 Th.33 Vin.ii.150 and *[kamala](/define/kamala)* was a grass used to make sandals Vin.i.190.

An oil extracted from the seeds is used to treat dysentery. Queen Mallikā built a debating hall near a prominent *tiṇḍuka* tree in a park at Sāvatthī D.i.178. We read of villagers building a bamboo fence around one of these trees to stop the monkeys from eating the fruit Ja.ii.76. A torch of *tiṇḍuka* wood, if struck, hisses, sputters and gives off sparks A.i.126.

Tulasi

Basil, sometimes *[sulasī](/define/sulasī)*, Hindi *tulsi*, *Ocimum sanctum* Ja.v.46 Ja.vi.536 Vin.iv.34, a small many\-branched herb with leaves covered with down and which grows throughout India. When crushed, the leaves have a pungent smell and taste and are chewed as a mouth freshener or an appetizer. Two other common species of basil are *Ocimum gratissimim* and *Ocimum basilicum*. Hindus consider Basil sacred to the family and the more religious will always have a bush growing somewhere near the house. When boiled, the leaves give a bright yellow oil which has antibacterial and insecticidal properties.

Medical uses for *Tulasi*

Root: For sudden collapse, decoction for malaria as diaphoretic. Leaf: as stimulant, antiperiodic, diaphoretic, expectorant, fever, constipation, liver disorders, with black pepper, Polygala crotalarioides and rice for coughs.

Palmyra Palm, sometimes *tālataruṇa*, Hindi *tad*, *Borassus flabellifer* D.ii.171 D.ii.182 M.i.187 Vin.i.188, a tall unbranched palm having large fan\-like leaves with thorns on the margins of the stalks. The round yellow fruit appears in large bunches. The leaves of the palmyra were used to make huts, fans, sunshades and various household articles Th.127. The sap of the male flower was used to make an alcoholic beverage called *jalogi*. Whether or not it was allowable for monks and nuns to drink unfermented *jalogi* was discussed at the Second Council Vin.ii.294. When reduced by boiling, this sap also made a gritty brown sugar which was called *sakkharā* Ja.i.251 Ja.i.348. The Buddha often describes the enlightened person’s destruction of the defilements to a palmyra trunk which, unlike many other trees, will not grow again after it is cut down A.i.137. Hatred, he said, should separate from the mind with the ease that a palmyra fruit separates from the stalk It.84. The Buddha’s radiant complexion was compared to the translucent yellow fruit from the palmyra palm just loosened from the stalk A.i.181. See [Kiṇṇa](/define/Kiṇṇa).

Ucchu

Sugar Cane, Hindi *ikshu*, a tall perennial grass with sharp\-edged leaves and a purplish segmented stem from which a sweet juice can be extracted. Many recent hybrid varieties of sugar cane grow in India today. *Carakasaṃhitā* mentions two types of sugar cane, the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* mentions 12 while only one type is specifically named in the Tipiṭaka, *ucchagaṇṭhikā*. Ja.i.339. One type grown in northern India since ancient times and was probably known to the Buddha’s contemporaries is *Saccharum barberi*.

To make sugar, cane stems were crushed in a mill and the juice reduced by boiling Ja.i.339. We read of the creaking sound made by the sugar mill Bv.2.168. It was said of a particularly oppressive king that he “crushed the people like sugar cane in a press” Ja.ii.240. The ancient Indians crystallized sugar, used it as syrup, powdered and made it into solid sticks or balls by mixing it with flour and or ash Ja.iv.17 Vin.i.210 Vin.iii.59 Vin.iv.111. There is a reference to a caravan transporting 500 jars of sugar Vin.i.224. Sometimes the juice was drunk freshly squeezed from the cane Vin.i.246 and an alcoholic beverage was made from it Vin.iv.109. Sometimes molasses (*[phāṇita](/define/phāṇita)*) was made Ja.ii.339 Vin.i.198. This was eaten straight or diluted with water and drunk Ja.iii.372, or mixed with hot water it was given as a medicine for wind disorders S.i.174. Rice porridge with ghee and sweetened with sugar was a popular food Ja.iv.39, and there was a type of confectionary called suger cake (*suguḷa*, Ja.vi.524). Baskets were made of cane Ja.iv.363 and temporary shelters were sometimes made out of it Vv.62.5. Ripe sugar cane could be struck by a disease called *[mañjiṭṭhikā](/define/mañjiṭṭhikā)* A.iv.278. Sugar cane was usually propagated from a segment of stem but also from seeds A.i.32.

Both the Great Cormorant, *Phalacrocorax carbo*, and the Little Cormorant *Phalacrocorax niger*. The Pāḷi name means “water crow” and the two birds are called *pan kowwa* in Hindi which has the same meaning Ja.iii.441. Both these cormorants are black with a small patch of white on the throat. The main difference between them is their size, the first being about as big as a domestic duck and the second about half that size. Also, the great cormorant has a yellow beak while the little cormorant’s is black. Both birds are commonly seen singly or in small flocks on large lakes where they hunt fish by diving and chasing them underwater. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a cormorant Ja.iii.149.

It grows up to 1.48 meters long, the tail making up to one fourth of its total length. The checkered keelback is India’s most common freshwater snake and frequents lakes, ponds, river banks and paddy fields where it feeds almost exclusively on frogs and fish. It is also an aggressive snake, striking rapidly, with great determination and holding on to its prey tenaciously.

Of the three species of otter found in northern India the most common is the Smooth\-Coated Otter, Hindi *ubdilao*, *Lutrogale perspicllata*. This creature has a long graceful body with short legs and a beautiful smooth, shiny, chocolate\-brown coat with a lighter underside. Otters live in rivers and streams and feed on fish, crustaceans, frogs and birds. Slippers were sometimes made out of otter skin Vin.i.186. One of the most famous Jātaka stories concerns two otters who ask a jackal to arbitrate a disagreement between them Ja.iii.333.

Udumbara

Cluster Fig, Hindi *dumbar*, *Ficus glomerata*, a large tree with a buttressed trunk, dark\-green ovate leaves and which produces reddish mildly sweet figs that grow in clusters on short branches. A spendthrift or a wastrel was called an “*udumbara* eater”, i.e. one who shakes all the figs out of the tree and then only eats a few A.iv.283. There was a grove of these trees near the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha where wandering ascetics used to stay and where the Buddha had a discussion with the ascetic Nigrodha D.iii.36.

Like several other species of Indian figs, this one was an object of curiosity to the ancient Indians because it appeared to produce fruit without first bearing flowers. The Buddha said that one cannot find an essence in existence any more than one can find a flower in a cluster fig Sn.5 Vv.50.16. The *Mahāvastu* says: “It is no easier to win sight of the Buddha, great in glory, empathy, compassion and beneficence, than it is to see a flower in a cluster fig” Mv.i.270. In fact, the fruit of the cluster fig itself is the flower. The head of the flower turns inward to produce a vase\-like fleshy casing inside which are numerous tiny flowers. The previous Buddha Koṇāgamana was enlightened under a cluster fig tree D.ii.4.

Brown Fish Owl, sometimes also *ulūkasakuṇa*, Hindi *ullu*, *Ketupa zeylonensis* Ja.v.120, a large brown bird with a lighter breast covered with vertical black streaks, prominent tufts or “horns” on its head and large yellow staring eyes. The fish owl favors thick jungle near water and feeds on crabs, fish, frogs, mammals and birds, and like all owls they are silent and stealth creatures A.v.289. The owl was considered the king of birds Ja.ii.242 Mil.403 and they have serious or sour faces. Some ascetics made coats out of owl’s wings or feathers A.i.241 D.i.167, and sandals were made out of their skins Vin.i.186. Owls could be observed sitting on the branch of a tree waiting for prey and giving the appearance that they were “meditating, contemplating, ruminating, speculating” M.i.335. When owls appear during the day they are mobbed by crows Ja.ii.208. See [Kosika](/define/Kosika).

The Pāḷi name means “mound builder”. Snakes and iguanas are often described as living in holes in termite mounds. Winged termites, called *[makkhikā](/define/makkhikā)*, sometimes swarm, particularly after rain Ja.i.488. At such times lizards and other animals gorge themselves on them, even people used to eat them with vinegar and sugar Ja.i.480\-81. Termites move from one place to another only after having built a tunnel in which to conceal themselves Mil.392. The Buddha said that a diligent layman’s wealth will grow like a termite’s mound D.iii.188.

Blue Water Lily, sometimes also *[indīvara](/define/indīvara)*, *Nymphaea stellata* Vv.45.5. The rhizome of this plant grows in the mud of ponds and swamps and its rounded leaves float on the surface. The large flowers have numerous spear\-shaped petals spiraling out from the bright yellow stamen and are a beautiful deep blue but sometimes crimson, white or pink. Their perfume was said to last for half a month Ja.vi.536 and a starry night sky is compared to their color J.v.93. The eyes of a beautiful woman were compared with a water lily bud Thi.382. Inhaling the perfume of the water lily was believed to have a curative effect Vin.i.279. Very similar to the blue water lily is the Small White Indian Water Lily, *N. esculenta*, with its white or sometimes yellow flower Vv.47.1. Water lilies are often incorrectly called and confused with the lotus. See [Sogandhika](/define/Sogandhika).

Sweet Flag, Hindi *bach* or *vacha*, *Acorus clamus* Vin.i.200. The root of this plant has a fragrance reminiscent of violets and is used in confectionery, perfume and in medicine for its stimulant, cathartic and diuretic properties. Sweet flag does not grow in northern India and was imported, probably from Kashmir or Persia. The Buddha considered it to be the most fragrant of all roots S.iii.157. The rhizome of sweet flag is chewed as a cure for colds and to alleviate asthma and is made into a tonic. The root is used as a vermifuge and for fever.

Medical uses for *Vaca*

Root: Chewed for coughs and colds, promotes bronchial secretion, asthma, diarrhea and dysentery, the oil is used as a nerve stimulant, sedative, analgesic, epilepsy, constipation. Stem: Cough and colds. Root: Vermifuge, in intermittent fever. Whole plant: Sedative, analgesic, depressant for blood pressure, rubbed on aching body parts.

Bat, winged mammals of the order Chiroptera. There are over 100 species of bats in India but it is not possible to identify any particular species from the information given in the Tipiṭaka. Bats sometimes lived in the darker corners of rooms and their droppings caused an unpleasant smell requiring monks to put screens on their windows to keep them out Vin.ii.148. One of the austerities practiced by some ascetics was called “the bat practice”. Perhaps it involved hanging upside down Ja.i.493 Ja.iii.235 Ja.iv.299.

Bamboo, also called *[veṇu](/define/veṇu)* and *[vaṃsa](/define/vaṃsa)*, grasses of the genes Bambusa Ja.v.38 Sn.38. Ranging in height from small to very tall and growing in dense clumps, bamboos have hollow segmented tube\-like stems and branches from which grow long spear\-shaped leaves. Over 30 varieties grow in northern India. Bamboo is an economically important plant, its strong but light and flexible wood being used for a wide variety of purposes. Washing was hung on bamboo poles and needle cases were made out of bamboo tubes. It was also plated and woven into baskets Vin.iv.5 and grown in lines to form hedges Vin.ii.154. Bamboo very rarely flowers, but when it does it dies Ja.v.71 S.ii.241. Its spreading fronds get tangled up with each other Sn.38 and young bamboo shoots are already hard and difficult to tread down Th.72. Workers in bamboo were considered low caste A.ii.85 A.iii.385.

One of the Buddha’s favorite resorts in Rājagaha was the Bamboo Grove, a park offered to him by King Bimbisāra Vin.iv.39. To this day dense thickets of the Thorny Bamboo, *Bambusa arundinacea*, grow around Rajgir, modern Rājagaha, and may be the type that was familiar to the Buddha. The ancient Buddhists believed that having the flexibility of bamboo would be a virtue. The Jātaka commented that to live successfully in the royal court it is wise to “bend like bamboo”Ja.vi.295. Nāgasena said: “Bamboo does not bend any which way, but the way the wind blows. Likewise the monk, having followed the nine parts of the Buddha’s, the Lord’s teachings and being established in that which is good and blameless, should go the way of true asceticism” Mil.ii.372. The popular trick where a man holds a bamboo pole erect and a child ascends it and balances on the top, was sometimes preformed as an entertainment S.v.168. A segment of bamboo, called a *nāḷi*, was used as a measure of capacity Ja.iv.67 Vin.i.249. See [Khuddakaveḷu](/define/Khuddakaveḷu) and [Mahāveḷu](/define/Mahāveḷu).

Scorpion, Hindi *bricchak*, an insectivorous anthropoid of the order Scorpiones, of which there are about 40 species in India A.ii.73 A.iii.101 D.ii.9. Ranging in color from tawny\-brown to blue\-black, scorpions have two claws and a long segmented tail that can grow up to 20 cm long with a sting on its end. During the rainy season, when scorpions are driven out of their holes by the water, people are more likely to be stung by them. The sting of the scorpion is extremely painful and can occasionally even be fatal. The Buddha mentioned the scorpion as an example of a creature that moves stealthily, especially when they sense human presence A.v.289. Knowing antidotes for scorpion stings was considered a special skill D.i.9. The *Milindapañha* says the scorpion’s tail is its weapon which it always keeps raised Mil.394. We read that sandals were sometimes decorated with a design resembling a scorpions” tails Vin.i.196.

Vitacchikā

Scabies, sometimes *[kacchū](/define/kacchū)* Nidd.ii.304, tiny mites of the genus Sarcoptes which burrow into the skin where they feed on blood The mite’s excretion causes intense itching, especially at night. Scabies is highly infectious and was one of the afflictions that could attack the body along with dysentery, leprosy, eczema, boils, etc A.v.110. The Buddha mentioned jackals suffering from a condition called *[ukkaṇṇaka](/define/ukkaṇṇaka)* which, judging by the name, had something to do with the ears S.ii.230. This would seem to be ear mange which is caused by the Otodectes and Psoroptes species of mite. The damage done to the ear by these mites is compounded by the infected animal’s continual scratching.

Vyaggha

Tiger, sometimes *[byaggha](/define/byaggha)*, Hindi *bagh*, *Panthera tigris* A.iii.101 D.iii.25 Dhp.295 Sn.416 Th.1113. This large majestic cat has an orange coat patterned with black stripes, a banded tail and black ears. Tigers live in thick jungle and thorny shrub where they hunt mainly deer. The tiger is not mentioned in the Vedas and only occasionally in the four Nikāyas. Perhaps they became common in northern India only as lions died out. In one place, the tiger is described as being striped and is called “the king of the beasts” a term usually used only for the lion Ja.iv.345. We read of a man\-eating tiger attacking travelers on the high road to Vārānasi Ja.i.357. The Buddha sometimes stayed with a clan of people known as Tiger’s Track, Vyagghapajjā A.ii.194. Royal chariots were upholstered with leopard or tiger skins Ja.vi.503, a fact also mentioned by Pāṇinī. In the Jātaka, there is a story about an accomplished but boastful magician who shows off his skill by bringing a dead tiger to life only to be eaten by it Ja.i.510.

Vānara

Hunuman Langur, also sometimes *[kapi](/define/kapi)* or *[gonaṅgula](/define/gonaṅgula)* Th.113 Th.601 *Semnophitecus entellus*. This large primate has a silver\-gray body with a white belly and a black face. With its long limbs and tail the langur moves through the trees or along the ground with a series of graceful bounds. There is intense competition to become the dominant male and one that does will immediately try to kill all the young so that the females will come into estrous and he can mate with them. This behavior seems to have been noticed by the ancient Indians and is probably the basis of the Tayodhamma Jātaka Ja.i.280\-2. In this story the dominant male of a troop of langurs castrates with his teeth all the infant males out of fear that they may grow up and replace him. Langurs have hands, feet and faces resembling those of humans Ja.iii.73 and they were occasionally kept as pets Ja.ii.184. The Buddha said that the distracted person “jumps from here to there like a langur searching for fruit in the forest” Dhp.334. In a story meant to illustrate the idea that greed can make one blind to one’s own benefit, the Jātaka tells of a langur who lets go of all the beans it had just to retrieve one that it had dropped Ja.ii.74. Another Jātaka describes a troop of langurs raiding a *[tiṇḍuka](/define/tiṇḍuka)* tree on the outskirts of a village Ja.ii.76.

Yava

Barley, Hindi *jau*, *Hordeum vulgare* A.i.8 S.v.10, an annual erect tufted grass resembling wheat and producing an edible grain. Cattle had to be prevented from wandering into barley fields and eating the crop S.iv.195. After harvesting, it was tied into sheaves and beaten with flails S.iv.201. Barley was used as food, fodder and in brewing. A popular preparation was called *yāvaka* Ja.vi.373 which Pāṇinī says was made by pounding barley in a mortar to remove the chaff and boiling it in either water or milk and then adding sugar. Barley meal, called *sattu*, was prepared as a gruel or made into a dough and baked Ja.iii.343 Vin.iv.78. The Buddha’s first meal after his enlightenment was barley gruel and honey balls offered to him by the merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka Vin.i.3. Monks put barley meal in their needle cases to prevent the needles from rubbing together and becoming blunt Vin.ii.116. In ancient India the width of a barley corn was used as a unit of measurement. The Buddha mentioned that the awn (*[suka](/define/suka)*) of a barley corn if positioned wrongly, could pierce the hand or foot and draw blood A.i.8. A proverb said that a person could get irritated the way a barley awn irritates the eye Ja.vi.294

 The Buddha mentioned another type of barley without naming it. He said: “When a barley field is ready, the contamination, the chaff, the rubbish of barley may appear, its root, stalk and leaf the same as true barley but without the same head. Only when the head forms do the farmers know ‘This is the contamination, the chaff, the rubbish of the true barley’ and knowing this they pull it out by the roots and throw it outside the barley field. And why? Because they think ‘Let it not contaminate the true barley’ ”A.iv.169. This is probably referring to Wild Barley, *Hordeum spontaneum*, the ancestor of *H. vulgae*, which looks very similar to it except that it has a shorter stem, narrower leaves and a smaller head. Wild barley competes with cultivated barley, lowers yields and is considered a weed.

Āmalaka

*Emblica officinalis*, Hindi *amal* Ja.iv.363 Vin.i.277 Vin.ii.149, a medium\-sized tree with greenish\-gray bark, yellow flowers and a pale\-green sour fruit with a large hard fluted seed. Together with *[harītaka](/define/harītaka)* and *[vibhītaka](/define/vibhītaka)* this fruit is one of the *triphala* or “three fruits”, long credited in traditional Indian medicine with powerful curative properties. It contains high concentrations of gallic acid and is rich in vitamin A, C and iron and either fresh or dried is taken for diarrhea and dyspepsia. It is also used in tonics or eaten dried, pickled or made into a tasty marmalade. Wood chips from the tree are used to clarify muddy water and wood cutters and honey gatherers working in the forest often take the fruit to suppress their thirst.

Medical uses for *Āmalaka*

Bark: applied to sores, pimples, with the bark of*Dillenia pentagyna* for tubercular fistula; for cholera, dysentery, diarrhea. Leaf: For gravel, diarrhea and sores. Fruit: Refrigerant, diuretic, laxative, for indigestion, with Swertia and fenugreek for gonorrhea. Raw fruit: aperient, dried and used in haemorrhagia, diarrhea, as a liver tonic, for scurvy, the juice as an eye drop. Seeds: For asthma and stomach disorders.

One of the reasons Buddhist monks and nuns shaved their heads was probably so they could not get and therefore did not have to kill head lice. One ancient Indian system of measurement took as its basic unit the louse’s egg, *likkhā*. Seven eggs equal the length of one louse.
