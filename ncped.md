2. participates, at the end of the rains\-residence, in a communal robe\-making, during which certain rules and practices are suspended (perhaps in order to facilitate the robe making); this involves: a) a *saṅghakamma* allotting the material (and the use of the *kaṭhina*) to a *bhikkhu* according to need and seniority; b) the preparation of the robe, by all the participating *bhikkhus*, from washing the cloth to adding the *kappabindu* the approval of the robe by one or more *bhikkhus* . Only those can take part and share the privileges who have spent the earlier rain\-retreat within that *sīmā* and have participated in the *pavāranā* ceremony. A minimum of five *bhikkhus* is required, but unqualified ones may make up the number without sharing the privileges. The donor gives cloth, sewing materials and food to the participating *bhikkhus* . The whole process must be completed in one day.
3. displays the finished robe.
