**[]()Abhibhāyatana:** the 8 'stages of mastery', are powers to be obtained by means of the kasina\-exercises see: [*kasina*](dic3_k.htm#kasina). In the [Com.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Com.) to [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 77, where [*āyatana*](#āyatana) is explained by 'means' *kārana* it is said: The **abhibhāyatana** through their counteracting may master and suppress their adverse opposite states, and by means of higher knowledge they may master the objects of mind. They are means for transcending the sense\-sphere.

The stereotype text often met with in the Suttas e.g. [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 11, 33; [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 77; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) VIII, 65; X, 29 is as follows:

As preparatory kasina\-object for the 1st and 2nd exercise one should choose on one’s own body a small or a large spot, beautiful or ugly, and thereon one should focus one’s full undivided concentration, so that this object after a while in mind is visualized as a mental reflex or image [*nimitta*](dic3_n.htm#nimitta) and, as if it were, as something external. Such an exercise, though appearing quite mechanical, if properly carried out will bring about a high degree of mental concentration and entrance into the 4 absorptions [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna). In the 3rd and 4th exercises the Bhikkhu by an external kasina\-object gains the mental reflexes and absorption see: As objects of the remaining exercises, perfectly clear and radiant colors should be chosen, flowers, cloth, etc.

A kasina\-object of small size is said to be suitable for a mentally unsteady nature, one of a large size for a dull nature, a beautiful object for an angry nature, an ugly one for a lustful nature.

In [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) V it is said: By means of the earth\- [kasina](dic3_k.htm#kasina) one succeeds in reaching the stage of mastery with regard to small and large objects. By means of the blue\- [kasina](dic3_k.htm#kasina) one succeeds in causing blue forms to appear, in producing darkness, in reaching the stage of mastery with regard to beautiful and ugly colours, in reaching 'deliverance through the beautiful', etc. cf. [*vimokkha*](dic3_v.htm#vimokkha) II, 3. The same is also said with regard to the other colour [kasinas](dic3_k.htm#kasina).

**[]()Anattā:** No\-self, egolessness, soullessness, [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā), absence of identity, is the last of the 3 universal characteristics of existence *[ti\-lakkhana](dic3_t.htm#ti-lakkhana).* This [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā) doctrine, which only is taught by a Buddha, teaches that neither within the bodily, material and mental phenomena of existence, nor outside of them, can be found anything at all, that in the ultimate sense could be regarded as a self\-existing, real & same, ego\-entity, identity, soul, self or independently existing substance. This is the central core doctrine of Buddhism, crucial for understanding the message & method of Buddhism. It is the only really specific Buddhist doctrine, with which the entire structure of the Buddhist teaching stands or falls. All the remaining Buddhist doctrines may, more or less, be found in other philosophic systems and religions, but the [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā) doctrine has been clearly and unreservedly taught only by the Buddha, wherefore the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) is known as the [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā) \- *vādi* or 'Teacher of [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) '. Whosoever has not penetrated this universal [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) of all existence, and does not comprehend that in reality there exists only this continually self\-consuming & self\-referring process of arising and passing away of bodily, material and mental phenomena, and that there is no separate ego\-entity or stable and same core neither within nor outside this process, he will not be able to understand Buddhism, i.e. the teaching of the 4 Noble Truths [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca), in the right light. He will think that it is his ego, his personality, that experiences suffering, his personality that performs good and evil actions and will be reborn according to these actions, his personality that will enter into Nibbāna, his personality that walks on the 8\-fold [path](dic3_m.htm#magga). This is the fatal 'personalist\-view' *[sakkāya\-ditthi](dic3_s.htm#sakkāya-ditthi)* and self\-deception *[māna](dic3_m.htm#māna)* 'I Am' that keep beings wandering in *[Samsāra](dic3_s.htm#samsāra).* Thus it is said in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVI:

>
>
>
>
> Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;  
> Actions are, but no actor is ever found;  
> *[Nibbāna](dic3_n.htm#Nibbāna)* is, but no being exists that enters it;  
> The [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) is, but no traveler is seen.
>
>
>
>

Whosoever does not understand the origin of conditionally arisen phenomena, and does not comprehend that all the actions are conditioned by ignorance, greed and hate, he thinks that it is an ego or self that understands or does not understand, that acts or causes to act, and that comes into existence at rebirth. He believes there exists an identity 'I' that has the sense\-contact, that feels, desires, becomes attached, continues and at rebirth again enters a new existence as the same being… [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.html#Vis.M.) XVII, 117.

While in the case of the first two characteristics it is stated that all constructions *sabbe [sankhārā](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra)* are impermanent and subject to suffering, the corresponding text for the third characteristic states that all states, all phenomena are no\-self *sabbe [dhammā](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) [anattā](#anattā)* [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 35, [Dhp.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Dhp.) 279. This is for emphasizing that the common false view of an abiding, same, constant, identical self or substance is neither applicable to any 'construction', whether internal or external, whether physical or mental nor to any conditioned phenomenon, nor to *[Nibbāna](dic3_n.htm#Nibbāna),* the only Unconditioned Element *[asankhatā](#asankhata)* \- [dhātu](dic3_d.htm#dhātu).

The [Anattā\-lakkhana Sutta](../DPPN/ay/anattalakhana_s.htm), the 'Discourse on the Characteristic of No\-self', was the second discourse after Enlightenment, preached by the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) to his [first five](../DPPN/pa/pancavaggiya.htm) disciples, who after hearing it attained to perfect Nobility *[Arahatta](#arahatta-magga).*

The contemplation of no\-self [*anattānupassanā*](dic3_a.htm#anattānupassanā) leads to the emptiness liberation [*suññatā\-vimokkha*](dic3_s.htm#suññatā-vimokkha) see. [*vimokkha*](dic3_v.htm#vimokkha). Herein the ability of understanding *[paññindriya](dic3_i.htm#paññindriya)* is outstanding, and one who attains in that way the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) of [Stream\-entry](#Stream-winner) is called a Dhamma\-devotee *[dhammānusāri](#dhammānusārī)* see: [*ariya\-puggala*](dic3_a.htm#ariya-puggala), at the next two stages of sainthood he becomes a vision\-attainer *[ditthippatta](#ditthippatta);* and at the highest stage, i.e. Nobility, he is called 'liberated by understanding' [*paññā* \- *vimutta*](dic3_p.htm#paññā-vimutti).

**[]()Anicca:** Impermanent, transient or, as abstract noun, *aniccatā* [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca) or change is the first of the three universal characteristics of existence *[tilakkhana](dic3_t.htm#ti-lakkhana),* which is easily observable and thus obvious. It is from this all\-embracing fact of [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca) that the other two universal characteristics, suffering [*dukkha*](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) and no\-self [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā), are derived see: [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XXII, 15; [Ud.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Ud.) IV, I

[impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca) of things is the arising, passing and changing of things, or the disappearance of things that have emerged & become into being. The meaning is that these things never persist in the same static state, but that they are changing, decaying, dissolving, and vanishing from moment to moment [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) VII, 3.

[impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca) is a basic feature of all conditioned phenomena, be they material or mental, coarse or subtle, one’s own or other’s, internal or external: All these compounded constructions are impermanent *sabbe sankhārā aniccā* [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 35, [Dhp.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Dhp.) 277. That the totality of existence is impermanent is also often stated in terms of the five aggregates or clusters [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha), the twelve internal and external sense sources [*āyatana*](#āyatana). Only *[Nibbāna](dic3_n.htm#Nibbāna),* which is unconditioned and not a construction [*asankhata*](dic3_a.htm#asankhata), is permanent, stable, still, static, lasting and constant *nicca* *dhuva.*

The insight leading to the first stage of deliverance: Stream\-entry [*sotāpatti*](dic3_s.htm#sotāpatti) see: *[ariya\-puggala](dic3_a.htm#ariya-puggala),* is often expressed in terms of [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca): Whatever is subject to origination, is also subject to ceasing see: [Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta](../DPPN/d/dhammacakkappavattana.htm), see: [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XLVI, 11. In his last exhortation, before his Parinibbāna, the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) reminded his Bhikkhus of the inevitable [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca) of all existence as a spur to earnest effort: Bhikkhus, I tell you: All constructions are bound to vanish. Strive enthusiasticly! *Vayadhammā sankhārā, appamādena sampādetha;* [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 16.

Without this deep insight into the [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca) and insubstantiality of all phenomena of existence there is no mental release, no relinquishment, no attainment of deliverance.

These things are called 'latent tendencies' since, in consequence of their endurance, they ever and again \- life after life\- tend to become the conditions for the arising of ever new sense\-greed, etc. [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XXII, 60.

Thereafter it gives an explanation concerning their overcoming, their penetration, etc. Cf. [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide) VI vii. According to [Kath.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Kath.) several ancient Buddhist schools erroneously held the opinion that the *anusayas* as such, meant merely latent, hence kammically neutral qualities, which however contradicts the Theravāda conception.

At the time when the Noble Disciple recollects the Perfect One… at such a time his mind is neither possessed of greed, nor of hate, nor of confusion. Quite upright at such a time is his mind owing to the Perfect One… With upright mind the Noble Disciple attains understanding of the meaning, understanding of the law of Dhamma, and attains to joy through the law of Dhamma. In the joyous one rapture arises. With heart enraptured, his whole being becomes stilled. Stilled within his being, he feels happiness; and the mind of the happy one becomes firm. Of this Noble Disciple it is said that amongst those gone astray, he walks on the right [path](dic3_m.htm#magga), among those suffering he abides free from suffering. Thus having reached the stream of the law, he develops and expands this recollection of the Enlightened One. [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) VI, 10.

In [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) VIII,10 and [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) IX, 16 the *[gotrabhū](dic3_g.htm#gotrabhū)* is listed as the 9th noble individual.

According to the Abhidhamma, the supra\-mundane [path](dic3_m.htm#magga), or simply [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) [*magga*](dic3_m.htm#magga), is a designation of the moment of entering into one of these 4 stages of Nobility with *[Nibbāna](dic3_n.htm#Nibbāna)* being the object, produced by intuitional insight [*vipassanā*](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā) into the [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca), [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) and [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) of existence, flashing forth and forever transforming one’s life and nature. By fruition [*phala*](dic3_p.htm#phala) is meant those moments of consciousness which follow immediately thereafter as the result of the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga), and which in certain circumstances may repeat for innumerable times during the life\-time.

In the Ariya\-vamsa Sutta, [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) IV, 28 and similarly in [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 33, it is said:

Now the Bhikkhu is contented with any robe, with any alms\-food, with any dwelling, finds pleasure and enjoyment in mental training and detachment. But neither is he haughty on that account, nor does he look down upon others. Now, of a Bhikkhu who herein is fit and indefatigable, who remains aware and clearly comprehending, of such a Bhikkhu it is said that he is firmly established in the ancient lineage of Noble Usage known as the most lofty one.

**[]()Asmi\-māna:** lit.: 'I am'\-conceit, 'ego\-conceit', may range from the coarsest pride and self\-assertion to a subtle feeling of one’s distinctiveness or superiority that persists, as the 8th fetter [*samyojana*](dic3_s.htm#samyojana), until the attainment of Arahatship or Nobility. It falsely assumes an entity 'I' the be real and existent. It is based upon the comparison of oneself with others, and may, therefore, manifest itself also as a feeling of inferiority or the claim to be equal see: [*māna*](dic3_m.htm#māna). It has to be distinguished from 'ego\-belief' [*sakkāya\-ditthi*](dic3_s.htm#sakkāya-ditthi) which implies a definite belief or view [*ditthi*](dic3_d.htm#ditthi) concerning the assumption of a self, personality or soul, and, being the 1st of the mental chains, which disappears at attainment of Stream\-Entry [*sotāpatti*](dic3_s.htm#sotāpatti). Even when the five lower mental chains have vanished in a Noble Disciple, there is still in him, with regard to the five groups of clinging, a slight remaining measure of the conceit 'I am', of the desire 'I am', of the latent tendency 'I am' see: [S](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.).

```

**[]()Avijjā:** I gnorance, nescience, the blindness of not knowing, is synonymous with confusion [*moha*](dic3_m.htm#moha) (see *[mūla](dic3_m.htm#mūla)* ), is the primary & deepest root of all evil and suffering in the world, veiling man’s mental eyes and preventing him from seeing the true nature of things. It is the confusion that fools beings by making life appear to them as permanent, happy, substantial and beautiful and preventing them from seeing that everything in reality is impermanent, liable to suffering, void of 'I' and 'mine', and basically impure see: [*vipallāsa*](dic3_v.htm#vipallāsa). Ignorance is defined as not knowing the [Four Noble Truths](dic3_s.htm#sacca), namely, suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the way to its ceasing see: [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XII, 4.

As ignorance is the foundation of all life\-maintaining actions, and the root of all evil and suffering, it therefore stands first in the formula of Dependent Origination [*paticca* \- *samuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda). But for that reason, says [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII, 36f ignorance should not be regarded as the causeless root\-cause of the world, since is not causeless. The cause of it is stated thus: With the arising of mental fermentations [*āsava*](dic3_a.htm#āsava) there is the arising of ignorance [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 9. But there is a figurative way in which it can be treated as a root\-cause; namely, when it is made to serve as a starting point in an exposition of the Round of Existence… As it is said: No first beginning of ignorance can be perceived, Bhikkhus, before which ignorance was not, and after which it came to be. But it can be perceived that ignorance has its specific causal condition *idappaccaya* [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) X, 61. The same statement is made [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) X, 62 about the craving for existence [*bhava\-tanhā*](dic3_b.htm#bhava-tanhā) (see *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* ). Craving and ignorance are called the outstanding causes or creators of the kamma that lead to unhappy and happy destinies [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII, 38.

As ignorance still exists though in a very refined way until the attainment of Arahatship, it is counted as the last of the 10 mental chains *[samyojana](dic3_s.htm#samyojana),* which bind beings to the cycle of rebirths. As the first two roots of evil, greed and hate (see: *[mūla](dic3_m.htm#mūla)* ), are on their part rooted in ignorance, consequently all disadvantageous states of mind are inseparably bound up with ignorance. Ignorance or confusion is the most obstinate, dense, deep, subtle, hidden and fearsome of the three roots of evil.

Ignorance is one of the fermentations [*āsava*](dic3_a.htm#āsava) and latent tendencies [*anusaya*](dic3_a.htm#anusaya). It is often called a hindrance [*nīvarana*](dic3_n.htm#nīvarana) e.g. in [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XV, 3; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) X, 61 but does not appear together with the usual list of five hindrances. It is however immanent in them all, yet especially dominant in doubt & uncertainty *[vicikicchā](dic3_v.htm#vicikicchā).*

Their particular aspect, distinguishing them from the corresponding 5 spiritual abilities [*indriya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya), is that they are unshakable by their opposites: 1 the power of faith is unshakable by faithlessness unbelief; 2 energy, by laziness; 3 awareness or mindfulness, by forgetfulness; 4 concentration, by distractedness; 5 understanding, by ignorance see [Pts.M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Pts.M.), ñāna Kathā. They represent, therefore, the aspect of firmness in the spiritual abilities.

According to [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) V. 15, the power 1 becomes manifest in the 4 qualities of the Stream\-winner [*sotāpannassa angāni*](dic3_s.htm#sotāpannassa%20angāni), 2 in the 4 right efforts see: [*padhāna*](dic3_p.htm#padhāna), 3 in the 4 foundations of awareness or mindfulness [*satipatthāna*](dic3_s.htm#satipatthāna), 4 in the 4 absorptions [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna), 5 in the full comprehension of the 4 Noble Truths [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca).

**[]()Bhavanga\-sota:** and **[]()Bhavanga\-citta:** The first term may tentatively be rendered as the 'undercurrent forming the condition of being, or existence', and the second as 'subconsciousness', though, as will be evident from the following, it differs in several respects from the usage of that term in Western psychology. [*Bhavanga*](dic3_B.htm#Bhavanga) [*bhava\-anga*](dic3_b.htm#bhava-anga), which, in the canonical works, is mentioned twice or thrice in the Patthāna, is explained in the Abhidhamma commentaries as the foundation or condition [*kārana*](dic3_k.htm#kārana) of existence [*bhava*](dic3_b.htm#bhava), as the [*sine,* *qua*](dic3_s.htm#sine%20qua%20non) of life, having the nature of a process, lit. a flux or stream [*sota*](dic3_s.htm#sota). Herein, since time immemorial, all contacts and experiences are, as it were, stored up, or better said, are functioning, but concealed as such to full consciousness, from where however they occasionally emerge as subconscious phenomena and approach the threshold of full consciousness, or crossing it become fully conscious. This so\-called 'subconscious life\-stream' or undercurrent of life is that by which might be explained the ability of memory, paranormal psychic phenomena, mental and physical growth, kamma and rebirth. etc. An alternative rendering is 'life\-continuum'.

It should be noted that [*bhavanga\-citta*](dic3_b.htm#bhavanga-citta) is a kamma\-resultant state of consciousness [*vipāka*](dic3_v.htm#vipāka), and that, in birth as a human or in higher forms of existence, it is always the result of good, or advantageous kamma [*kusala\-kamma\-vipāka*](dic3_k.htm#kusala-kamma-vipāka), though in varying degrees of strength see: [*patisandhi*](dic3_p.htm#patisandhi), end of the article. The same holds true for rebirth consciousness [*patisandhi*](dic3_p.htm#patisandhi) and death consciousness [*cuti*](dic3_c.htm#cuti), which are only particular manifestations of subconsciousness. In [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XIV it is said:

As soon as rebirth\-consciousness in the embryo at the time of conception has ceased, there arises a similar subconsciousness with exactly the same object, following immediately upon rebirth\-consciousness and being the result of this or that kamma intentional action done in a former birth and remembered there at the moment before death. And again a further similar state of subconsciousness arises. Now, as long as no other consciousness arises to interrupt the continuity of the life\-stream, so long the life\-stream, like the flow of a river, rises in the same way again and again, even during dreamless sleep and at other times. In this way one has to understand the continuous arising of those states of consciousness in the life\-stream. Cf. [*viññāna\-kicca*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca).

**[]()Bhikkhu:** A fully ordained disciple of the Buddha is called a Bhikkhu. Mendicant Bhikkhu may be suggested as the closest equivalent for Bhikkhu, literally it means he who begs but Bhikkhus do not beg. They silently stand at the door for food. They live on what is spontaneously given by the supporters. He is not a priest as he is no mediator between God and man. He has no vows for life, but he is bound by his rules which he takes of his own accord. He leads a life of voluntary poverty and celibacy. If he is unable to live the Noble Life, he can discard the robe at any time.

**[]()Bhāvanā:** 'mental development' lit. 'calling into existence, producing' is what in English is generally but rather vaguely called 'meditation'. One has to distinguish 2 kinds: development of tranquillity [*samatha\-bhāvanā*](dic3_s.htm#samatha-bhāvanā), i.e. concentration [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi), and development of insight *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā)* \- *[bhāvanā](dic3_b.htm#bhāvanā),* i.e. understanding *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā).*

These two important terms, tranquillity and insight see: [*samatha\-vipassanā*](dic3_s.htm#samatha-vipassanā), are very often met with and explained in the Sutta, as well as in the Abhidhamma.

Tranquillity [*samatha*](dic3_s.htm#samatha) is the concentrated, unshaken, peaceful, and therefore undefiled state of mind, whilst insight [*vipassanā*](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā) is the intuitive insight into the [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca), [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) and [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) [*anicca*](dic3_a.htm#anicca) [*dukkha*](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā) see: [*tilakkhana*](dic3_t.htm#tilakkhana) of all bodily and mental phenomena of existence, included in the 5 groups of existence, namely, materiality, feeling, perception, mental constructions and consciousness; see: [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha).

Tranquillity, or concentration of mind, according to Sankhepavannana Commentary to Abhidhammattha\-sangaha, bestows a threefold blessing: favourable rebirth, present happy life, and purity of mind which is the condition of insight. Concentration [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) is the indispensable foundation and precondition of insight by purifying the mind from the 5 mental defilements or hindrances [*nīvarana*](dic3_n.htm#nīvarana), whilst insight [*vipassanā*](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā) produces the 4 supra mundane stages of Nobility and deliverance of mind. The [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) therefore says: May you develop mental concentration, o Bhikkhus; for who is mentally concentrated, sees things according to reality see: XXII, 5. And in [Mil.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Mil.) it is said: Just as when a lighted lamp is brought into a dark chamber, the lamp\-light Will destroy the darkness and produce and spread the light, just so will insight, once arisen, destroy the darkness of ignorance and produce the light of knowledge.

[Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) III\-XI gives full directions how to attain full concentration and the absorptions [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna) by means of the following 40 meditation subjects [*kammatthāna*](dic3_k.htm#kammatthāna):

Among these, the recollection or awareness or mindfulness of in\-and\-out breathing may produce all the 4 absorptions, that of the body the 1st absorption, the rest only neighbourhood\-concentration [*upacāra\-samādhi*](dic3_u.htm#upacāra-samādhi), see: [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi).

**[]()Bodhi:** from verbal root *budhi* to awaken, to understand: awakening, enlightenment, supreme knowledge. Through Bodhi one awakens from the slumber or stupor inflicted upon the mind by the defilements [*kilesa*](dic3_k.htm#kilesa) and comprehends the Four Noble Truths [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) [Com.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Com.) to [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 10.

The enlightenment of a [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) is called [*sammā\-sambodhi*](dic3_s.htm#sammā-sambodhi) 'perfect enlightenment'. The faith [*saddhā*](dic3_s.htm#saddhā) of a lay follower of the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) is described as he believes in the enlightenment of the Perfect One *saddahati Tathāgatassa bodhim:* [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 53, [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) III, 2.

As components of the state of enlightenment and contributory factors to its achievement, are mentioned in the texts: the 7 factors of enlightenment [*bojjhanga*](dic3_b.htm#bojjhanga) = [*bodhi\-anga*](dic3_b.htm#bodhi-anga) and the 37 'things pertaining to enlightenment' *bodhipakkhiya* \- *dhammā.* In one of the later books of the Sutta\-Pitaka, the Buddhavamsa, 10 [*bodhipācana\-dhammā*](dic3_b.htm#bodhipācana-dhammā) are mentioned, i.e. qualities that lead to the ripening of perfect enlightenment; these are the 10 perfections [*pāramī*](dic3_p.htm#pāramī).

There is a threefold classification of enlightenment: 1. that of a Noble Disciple [*sāvaka\-bodhi*](dic3_s.htm#sāvaka-bodhi). i.e. of an Arahat, 2. of an Independently Enlightened One [*pacceka\-bodhi*](dic3_p.htm#pacceka-bodhi), and 3. of a Perfect Enlightened One [*sammā\-sambodhi*](dic3_s.htm#sammā-sambodhi) This 3\-fold division, however, is of later origin, and in this form it neither occurs in the canonical texts nor in the older Sutta commentaries. The closest approximation to it is found in a verse sutta which is probably of a comparatively later period, the Treasure Store Sutta Nidhikkanda Sutta of the Khuddakapātha, where the following 3 terms are mentioned in stanza 15: *sāvaka\-pāramī, pacceka\-bodhi, buddha\-bhūmi* see [Khp.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Khp.) Tr., pp. 247f..

The commentaries e.g. to [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.), Buddhavamsa, Cariyapitaka generally give a 4\-fold explanation of the word bodhi: 1. the tree of enlightenment, 2. the Noble [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) [*ariya\-magga*](dic3_a.htm#ariya-magga), 3. Nibbāna, 4 omniscience of the Buddha: [*sabbaññutā* \-](dic3_s.htm#sabbaññutā-ñāna) [*ñāna*](dic3_n.htm#ñāna). As to 2, the commentaries quote Cula\-Nidesa where [*bodhi*](dic3_b.htm#bodhi) is defined as the knowledge relating to the 4 [paths](dic3_m.htm#magga) of Stream\-entry, etc.; [*catūsu,* *maggesu*](dic3_c.htm#catūsu%20maggesu%20ñāna).

Neither in the canonical texts nor in the old commentaries is it stated that a follower of the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) may choose between the three kinds of enlightenment and aspire either to become a Buddha, a Pacceka\-Buddha, or an Arahat\-disciple. This conception of a choice between three aspirations is, however, frequently found in present\-day Theravāda countries, e.g. in Sri Lanka.

**[]()Bodhisatta:** 'Enlightenment Being', is a being destined to Buddhahood, a future Buddha. According to the traditional belief a Bodhisatta, before reaching his last birth as a [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) on this earth, is living in the Tusita\-heaven see: [*deva*](dic3_d.htm#deva), the heaven of bliss. Cf. [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) IV, 127; VIII, 70.

In the Pāli Canon and commentaries, the designation 'Bodhisatta' is given only to Prince Siddhattha before his enlightenment and to his former existences. The [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) himself uses this term when speaking of his life prior to enlightenment e.g. [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 4, [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 26. Bodhisattahood is neither mentioned nor recommended as an ideal higher than or alternative to Arahatship; nor is there any record in the Pāli scriptures of a disciple declaring it as his aspiration. \- See [*bodhi*](dic3_b.htm#bodhi).

Though in the 2nd factor, [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) \- *vicaya* the word [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) is taken by most translators to stand for the Buddhist doctrine, it probably refers to the bodily and mental phenomena *nāma* \- [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) \- *dhammā* as presented to the investigating mind by awareness or mindfulness, the 1st factor.

**[]()Citta\-kkhana:** 'consciousness\-moment', is the time occupied by one single stage in the perceptual process or cognitive series *cittavīthi* see: [*viññāna\-kicca*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca) This moment again is subdivided into the genetic *uppāda* static *thiti* and dissolving *bhanga* moment. One such moment is said in the commentaries to be of inconceivably short duration and to last not longer than the billionth part of the time occupied by a flash of lightning. However that may be, we ourselves know from experience that it is possible within one single second to dream of innumerable things and events. In [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) I, 10 it is said:;Nothing, o Bhikkhus, do I know that changes so rapidly as consciousness. Scarcely anything may be found that could be compared with this so rapidly changing consciousness.; [App.](dic2-abbrev.htm#App.) [*khana*](dic3_k.htm#khana).

To be in dread of what one ought to be in dread of, to be in dread of performing evil and disadvantageous things: this is called Fear of Wrongdoing; Pug, 79, 80.

Two lucid things, o Bhikkhus, protect the world: moral shame and Fear of Wrongdoing. If these two things were not to protect the world, then one would respect neither one’s mother, nor one’s mother’s sister, nor one’s brother’s wife, nor one’s teacher’s wife.; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.)

**[]()Iddhi:** 'power', 'magical power'. The magical powers constitute one of the 6 kinds of higher spiritual powers [*abhiññā*](dic3_a.htm#abhiññā). One distinguishes many kinds of magical powers: the power of determination *adhitthān* [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) i.e. the power of becoming oneself many; the power of transconstruction *vikubbana* [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) i.e. the power of adopting another form; the power of spiritual creation *manomaya* [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) i.e. the power of letting issue from this body another mentally produced body; the power of penetrating knowledge [*ñāna*](dic3_n.htm#ñāna) \- *vipphara* [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) i.e. the power of inherent insight to remain unhurt in danger; the power of penetrating concentration *samādhivippharā* [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) producing the same result. The magical powers are treated in detail in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XII; [Pts.M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Pts.M.), [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.) \- [App.](dic2-abbrev.htm#App.). They are not a necessary condition for final deliverance.

'Noble power' *ariyā* \- [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) is the power of controlling one’s ideas in such a way that one may consider something not repulsive as repulsive and something repulsive as not repulsive, and remain all the time imperturbable and full of equanimity. This training of mind is frequently mentioned in the Suttas e.g. [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 152, [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) V. 144, but only once the name of *ariyā* \- [*iddhi*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi) is applied to it [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 28. See further [Pts.M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Pts.M.), Iddhi\-kathā, [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XII.

**[]()Iddhi\-pāda:** 'roads to power' or success are the 4 following qualities,,for as guides, they indicate the road to power connected therewith; and because they form, by way of preparation, the roads to the power constituting the fruition of the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga); [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XII, namely:;concentration of intention [*chanda*](dic3_c.htm#chanda) \- [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) accompanied by effort of will [*padhāna*](dic3_p.htm#padhāna) \- [*sankhāra*](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra) \- *samannāgata* concentration of energy *[viriya](dic3_v.htm#viriya)* \- [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi)… concentration of consciousness [*citta*](dic3_c.htm#citta) \- [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi).. and concentration of investigation *vimamsa* \- [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) accompanied by effort of will.; As such, they are supra\-mundane [*lokuttara*](dic3_l.htm#lokuttara) i.e. connected with the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) or the fruition of the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga); see: *[ariya\-puggala](dic3_a.htm#ariya-puggala)* But they are mundane [*lokiya*](dic3_l.htm#lokiya) as predominant factors [*adhipati*](dic3_a.htm#adhipati) see: [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya), for it is said:;Because the monk, through making intention a predominant factor, reaches concentration, it is called the concentration of intention [*chanda*](dic3_c.htm#chanda) \- [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) etc.; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XII.

These 4 roads of power lead to the attaining and acquiring of magical power, to the power of magical transconstruction, to the generation of magical power, and to mastery and skill therein; [Pts.M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Pts.M.) II. 205, [PTS](dic2-abbrev.htm#PTS). For a detailed explanation, see: [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XII.

Once the Bhikkhu has thus developed and often practised the 4 roads to power, he enjoys various magical powers,… hears with the divine ear divine and human sounds,… perceives with his mind the mind of other beings… remembers many a former existence… perceives with the divine eye beings passing away and reappearing,… attains, after the ceasing of fermentations, deliverance of mind and deliverance through understanding, free from. fermentations. see: LI, 2. For a detailed explanation of these 6 higher powers, see: [*abhiññā*](dic3_a.htm#abhiññā)

Whosoever, o Bhikkhus, has missed the 4 roads to power, he has missed the right [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) leading to the ceasing of suffering; but whosoever, o Bhikkhus, has reached the 4 roads to power, he has reached the right [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) leading to the ceasing of suffering; see: LI, 2.

**[]()Indriya\-samatta:** 'equilibrium, balance, or harmony of abilities', relates to the 5 spiritual abilities: faith, energy, awareness or mindfulness, concentration and understanding see: [*indriya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya) 15\-19. Of these there are two pairs of abilities, in each of which both abilities should well counter\-balance each other, namely: faith and understanding *[saddhā](dic3_s.htm#saddhā)* *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā)* on the one hand and energy and concentration [*viriya*](dic3_v.htm#viriya) [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) on the other. For excessive faith with deficient understanding leads to blind belief, whilst excessive understanding with deficient faith leads to cunning. In the same way, great energy with weak concentration leads to restlessness, whilst strong concentration with deficient energy leads to indolence. Though for both abilities in each of the 2 pairs a balanced degree of intensity is desirable, awareness or mindfulness should be allowed to develop to the highest degree of strength. Cf.

**[]()Javana:** fr. *javati* to impel: 'impulsion', is the phase of full cognition in the cognitive series, or perceptual process [*citta\-vīthi*](dic3_c.htm#citta-vīthi) see. [*viññāna\-kicca*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca) occurring at its climax, if the respective object is large or distinct. It is at this phase that kamma is produced, i.e. advantageous or disadvantageous intention concerning the perception that was the object of the previous stages of the respective process of consciousness. There are normally 7 impulse moments. In mundane consciousness [*lokiya*](dic3_l.htm#lokiya), any of the 17 kammically advantageous classes of consciousness [Tab. I](table1.htm), 1\-17 or of the 12 disadvantageous ones [Tab. I](table1.htm), 22\-23 may arise at the phase of impulsion. For the Arahat, however, impulsion has no longer a kammic, i.e. rebirth\-producing character, but is a kammically independent function [*kiriya*](dic3_k.htm#kiriya) [Tab. I](table1.htm), 72\-89. There are further 8 supra\-mundane classes of impulsion [Tab. I](table1.htm), 18\-21, 66\-69.

The 4 impulse moments immediately before entering an absorption [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna) or one of the supra\-mundane [paths](dic3_m.htm#magga) [*magga*](dic3_m.htm#magga) see. *[ariya\-puggala](dic3_a.htm#ariya-puggala)* are: the preparatory [*parikamma*](dic3_p.htm#parikamma) approach [*upacāra*](dic3_u.htm#upacāra) adaptation *anuloma* and change\-of\-lineage\-moment *[gotrabhū](dic3_g.htm#gotrabhū)* In connection with entering the earth\-kasina absorption see: [*kasina*](dic3_k.htm#kasina) they are explained as follows, in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) IV:;After the breaking off of the subconscious stream of being [*bhavanga\-sota*](dic3_b.htm#bhavanga-sota), there arises the 'directing at the mind\-door' *manodvārāvajjana* see: *viññānakicca,* taking as object the earthkasina whilst thinking, 'Earth! Earth!' Thereupon, 4 or 5 impulse moments flash forth, amongst which the last one change\-of\-lineage\-moment belongs to the fine\-material sphere [*rūpāvacara*](dic3_r.htm#rūpāvacara) whereas the rest belong to the sense\-sphere [*kāmāvacara*](dic3_k.htm#kāmāvacara), see: [*avacara*](dic3_a.htm#avacara) though the last one is more powerful in thought conception, discursive thinking, interest rapture, joy and concentration cf. [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna) than the states of consciousness belonging to the sense\-sphere. They are called 'preparatory' [*parikamma\-samādhi*](dic3_p.htm#parikamma-samādhi) as they are preparing for the attainment\-concentration *appanā* \- *samādhi;* access [*upacāra\-samādhi*](dic3_u.htm#upacāra-samādhi) as they are close to the attainment\-concentration and are moving in its neighbourhood; adaptive *anuloma* as they adapt themselves to the preceding preparatory states and to the succeeding attainment concentration. The last one of the four is called 'matured' gotrabhū. In a similar way, the impulse moments before reaching the divine ear are described in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XIII, 1. \- Cf. Kamma \- [App.](dic2-abbrev.htm#App.).

**[]()Jhāna:** 'absorption' meditation refers chiefly to the four meditative absorptions of the fine\-material sphere [*rūpa\-jjhāna*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa-jjhāna) or [*rūpāvacara*](dic3_r.htm#rūpāvacara) \- *jjhāna* [*avacara*](dic3_a.htm#avacara) They are achieved through the attainment of full or attainment \-, or ecstatic concentration *appanā* see: [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) during which there is a complete, though temporary, suspension of fivefold sense\-activity and of the 5 hindrances see: [*nīvarana*](dic3_n.htm#nīvarana) The state of consciousness, however, is one of full alertness and lucidity. This high degree of concentration is generally developed by the practice of one of the 40 subjects of tranquillity meditation [*samatha*](dic3_s.htm#samatha) \- [*kammatthāna*](dic3_k.htm#kammatthāna) see. *[bhāvanā](dic3_b.htm#bhāvanā)* Often also the 4 immaterial spheres *arūpāyatana* are called absorptions of the immaterial sphere [*arūpa\-jjhāna*](dic3_a.htm#arūpa-jjhāna) or *[arūpāvacara](dic3_a.htm#arūpāvacara)* \- *jjhāna* The stereotype text, often met with in the Suttas, runs as follows:

They are the perceptions of visible objects, sounds, etc.' \- Surely, they do no longer exist even for one who has entered the 1st absorption, etc., for at such a time the five\-sense consciousness is no longer functioning. Nevertheless, this is to be understood as having been said in praise of this immaterial absorption, in order to incite the striving for it; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) X, 16.

Thus the 1st absorption is free from 5 things i.e. the hindrances, [*nīvarana*](dic3_n.htm#nīvarana), and 5 things are present i.e. the factors of absorption; [*jhānanga*](dic3_j.htm#jhānanga) Whenever the Bhikkhu enters the 1st absorption, there have vanished sense\-desire, ill\-will, lethargy and Laziness, restlessness and regrets, doubts; and there are present: thought\-conception *vitakka* discursive thinking [*vicāra*](dic3_v.htm#vicāra) rapture [*pīti*](dic3_p.htm#pīti), joy [*sukha*](dic3_s.htm#sukha) and concentration [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) In the 2nd absorption there are present: rapture, joy and concentration; in the 3rd: joy and concentration; in the 4th: equanimity *[upekkhā](dic3_u.htm#upekkhā)* and concentration; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) IV.

The 4 absorptions of the immaterial sphere see: above 5\-8 still belong, properly speaking, to the 4th absorption as they possess the same two constituents. The 4th fine\-material absorption is also the base or starting point *pādaka* \- [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna) for the attaining of the higher spiritual powers [*abhiññā*](dic3_a.htm#abhiññā).

In the Abhidhamma, generally a fivefold instead of a fourfold division of the fine\-material absorptions is used: the 2nd absorption has still the constituent 'discursive thinking' but without thought\-conception, while the 3rd, 4th and 5th correspond to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, respectively, of the fourfold division see: [Tab. I](table1.htm), 9\- 13. This fivefold division is based on sutta texts like A. VIII, 63.

For the 8 absorptions as objects for the development of insight *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā),* see samatha\- *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā)* \- Full details in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) IV\-X.

Jhāna in its widest sense e.g. as one of the 24 conditions; see: [paccaya](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) 17, denotes any, even momentary or weak absorption of mind, when directed on a single object.

'the going forth', or more fully stated, 'the going forth from home to the homeless life' of a Bhikkhu *agārasmā,* *anagāriyam* consists in severing all family and social ties to live the pure life of a monk, in order to realize the goal of final deliverance pointed out by the Enlightened One. Thus, **p.** has become the name for admission as a *sāmanera* or novice, i.e. as a candidate for the Order of Bhikkhus, or Bhikkhus.

**[]()Paccaya:** 'condition', is something on which something else, the so\-called 'conditioned thing', is dependent, and without which the latter cannot be. Many are the ways in which one thing, or one occurrence, may be the condition for some other thing, or occurrence. In the Patthāna, the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka comprising 6 large vols. in the Siamese edition, these 24 modes of conditionality are enumerated and explained, and then applied to all conceivable mental and physical phenomena and occurrences, and thus their conditioned nature is demonstrated.

The first two volumes of the Patthāna have been translated into English by the Venerable U Nārada [*mūla*](dic3_m.htm#mūla) patthāna Sayadaw of Burma, under the title Conditional Relations Published by the Pāli Text Society, London 1969, 1981. For a synopsis of this work, see [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide) VII.

The 24 modes of conditionality are:

1: Root\-condition [*hetu*](dic3_h.htm#hetu) \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) is that condition that resembles the root of a tree. Just as a tree rests on its root, and remains alive only as long as its root is not destroyed, similarly all kammically advantageous and disadvantageous mental states are entirely dependent on the simultaneity and presence of their respective roots, i.e, of greed [*lobha*](dic3_l.htm#lobha), hate [*dosa*](dic3_d.htm#dosa) confusion [*moha*](dic3_m.htm#moha) or greedlessness [*alobha*](dic3_a.htm#alobha) hatelessness [*adosa*](dic3_a.htm#adosa) unconfusedness [*amoha*](dic3_a.htm#amoha) For the definition of these 6 roots, see: [*mūla*](dic3_m.htm#mūla)

The roots are a condition by way of root for the mental phenomena associated with a root, and for the material phenomena produced thereby e.g. for bodily expression; Patth.

2: Object\-condition [*ārammana*](dic3_a.htm#ārammana) \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) is called something which, as object, forms the condition for consciousness and mental phenomena. Thus, the physical object of sight consisting in colour and light 'light\-wave', is the necessary condition and the sine qua non for the arising of visual\-consciousness [*cakkhu\-viññāna*](dic3_c.htm#cakkhu-viññāna) etc.; sound 'sound wave' for ear\-consciousness *sotā* \- [*viññāna*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna) etc.; further, any object arising in the mind is the condition for mind\-consciousness [*mano*](dic3_m.htm#mano) \- [*viññāna*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna) The mental\-object may be anything whatever, material or mental, past, present or future, real or imaginary.

3: []()Predominance\-condition [*adhipati\-paccaya*](dic3_a.htm#adhipati-paccaya) is the term for 4 things, on the preponderance and predominance of which are dependent the mental phenomena associated with them, namely: concentrated intention [*chanda*](dic3_c.htm#chanda), energy [*viriya*](dic3_v.htm#viriya), consciousness [*citta*](dic3_c.htm#citta) and investigation *vīmamsā* In one and the same state of consciousness, however, only one of these 4 phenomena can be predominant at a time.;Whenever such phenomena as consciousness and mental properties are arising by giving preponderance to one of these 4 things, then this phenomenon is for the other phenomena a condition by way of predominance; [Patth.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Patth.). Cf. [*iddhi\-pāda*](dic3_i.htm#iddhi-pāda)

4\-5: Proximity and contiguity or immediacy\-condition *anantara* and *[samanantara\-paccaya](dic3_s.htm#samanantara-paccaya)* \- both being identical \- refer to any state of consciousness and mental phenomena associated with them, which are the conditions for the immediately following stage in the process of consciousness. For example, in the visual process, visual\-consciousness is for the immediately following mindelement \- performing the function of receiving the visible object \- a condition by way of contiguity; and so is this mind\-element for the next following mind\-consciousness element, performing the function of investigating the object, etc. Cf. [*viññāna\-kicca*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca).

6: Co\-nascence condjtion [*sahajāta\-paccaya*](dic3_s.htm#sahajāta-paccaya) i.e. condition by way of simultaneous arising, is a phenomenon that for another one forms, a condition in such a way that, simultaneously with its arising, also the other thing must arise. Thus, for instance, in one and the same moment each of the 4 mental groups feeling, perception, mental constructions and consciousness is for the 3 other groups a condition by way of co\-nascence or co\-arising; or again each of the 4 physical elements solid, liquid, heat, motion is such a condition for the other 3 elements. Only at the moment of conception in the mother’s womb does materiality physical base of mind serve for the 4 mental groups as a condition by way of conascence.

7: Condition by way of mutuality [*aññāmañña\-paccaya*](dic3_a.htm#aññāmañña-paccaya) All the just mentioned associated and co\-nascent mental phenomena, as well as the 4 physical elements, are, of course, at the same time also conditioned by way of mutuality,;just like three sticks propped up one by another.; The 4 mental groups are one for another a condition by way of mutuality. So also are the 4 elements, and also mentality and materiality at the moment of conception.

8: Support\-condition [*nissaya\-paccaya*](dic3_n.htm#nissaya-paccaya) This condition refers either to a pre\-nascent see: 10 or co\-nascent see: 6 phenomenon which is aiding other phenomena in the manner of a foundation or base, just as the trees have the earth as their foundation, or as the oil\-painting rests on the canvas. In this way, the 5 sense\-organs and the physical base of the mind are for the corresponding 6 kinds of consciousness a prenascent, i.e. previously arisen, condition by way of support. Further all co\-nascent see: 6 phenomena are mutually see: 7 conditioned by each other by way of support.

9: Decisive\-support or inducement condition [*upanissaya\-paccaya*](dic3_u.htm#upanissaya-paccaya) is threefold, namely a by way of object *ārammanūpanissaya* \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) b by way of proximity *anantarūpanissaya* c natural decisive support *pakatupanissaya* These conditions act as strong inducement or cogent reason.

>
>
>
>
> a Anything past, present or future, material or mental, real or imaginary, may, as object of our thinking, become a decisive support, or strong inducement, to moral, immoral or kammically neutral states of mind. Evil things, by wrong thinking about them, become an inducement to immoral life; by right thinking, an inducement to moral life. But good things may be an inducement not only to similarly good things, but also to bad things, such as self\-conceit, vanity, envy, etc.

> c Faith, virtue, etc., produced in one’s own mind, or the influence of climate, food, etc., on one’s body and mind, may act as natural and decisive support\-conditions. Faith may be a direct and natural inducement to charity, virtue to mental training, etc.; greed to theft, hate to murder; unsuitable food and climate to ill\-health; friends to spiritual progress or deterioration.

10: Pre\-nascence\-condition [*purejāta\-paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#purejāta-paccaya) refers to something previously arisen, which forms a base for something arising later on. For example, the 5 physical sense\-organs and the physical base of mind, having already arisen at the time of birth, form the condition for the consciousness arising later, and for the mental phenomena associated therewith.

11: Post\-nascence\-condition *pacchā* \- *jāta* \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) refers to consciousness and the phenomena therewith associated, because they are \- just as is the feeling of hunger\- a necessary condition for the preservation of this already arisen body.

12: Repetition\-condition [*āsevana\-paccaya*](dic3_a.htm#āsevana-paccaya) refers to the kammical consciousness, in which each time the preceding impulse moments [*javana*](dic3_j.htm#javana) \- [*citta*](dic3_c.htm#citta) are for all the succeeding ones a condition by way of repetition and frequency, just as in learning by heart, through constant repetition, the later recitation becomes gradually easier and easier.

13: Kamma\-condition [*kamma\-paccaya*](dic3_k.htm#kamma-paccaya) The pre\-natal kamma i.e kamma\-intentions, [*kamma*](dic3_k.htm#kamma) \- *[cetanā](dic3_c.htm#cetanā)* in a previous birth is the generating condition cause of the 5 sense\-organs, the fivefold sense\-consciousness, and the other kamma\-produced mental and material phenomena in a later birth. \- Kammical intention is also a condition by way of kamma for the co\-nascent mental phenomena associated therewith, but these phenomena are in no way kamma\-results.

14: Kamma\-result\-condition [*vipāka\-paccaya*](dic3_v.htm#vipāka-paccaya) The kamma\-resultant 5 kinds of sense\-consciousness are a condition by way of kamma\-result for the co\-nascent mental and material phenomena.

15: Nutriment\-condition [*āhāra*](dic3_a.htm#āhāra) \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) For the 4 nutriments, see: [*āhāra*](dic3_a.htm#āhāra)

16: Ability\-condition [*indriya\-paccaya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya-paccaya) This condition applies to 20 abilities [*indriya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya), leaving out No. 7 and 8 from the 22 abilities. Of these 20 abilities, the 5 physical sense\-organs 1 \- 5, in their capacity as abilities, form a condition only for unmaterial phenomena visual\-consciousness etc.; physical vitality 6 and all the remaining abilities, for the co\-nascent mental and material phenomena.

17: Jhāna\-condition [*jhāna\-paccaya*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna-paccaya) is a name for the 7 so\-called jhāna\-factors, as these form a condition to the co\-nascent mental and material phenomena, to wit: 1 thought\-conception *vitakka* 2 discursive thinking [*vicāra*](dic3_v.htm#vicāra) 3 interest [*pīti*](dic3_p.htm#pīti) 4 joy [*sukha*](dic3_s.htm#sukha) 5 sadness [*domanassa*](dic3_d.htm#domanassa) 6 indifference *[upekkhā](dic3_u.htm#upekkhā)* 7 concentration [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) For definition s. Pāli terms.

1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in 4 classes of greedy consciousness see: [Tab. I](table1.htm). 22\-25; 1, 2, 5, 7 in hateful consciousness ib. 30, 31; 1, 2, 6, 7 in the classes of confused consciousness ib. 32, 33.

This condition does not only apply to [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna) alone, but also to the general intensifying 'absorbing' impact of these 7 factors.

18 [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) \-condition [*magga\-paccaya*](dic3_m.htm#magga-paccaya) refers to the 12 [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) \-factors, as these are for the kammically advantageous and disadvantageous mental phenomena associated with them, a way of escape from this or that mental constitution, namely: 1 knowledge *paññā = sammāditthi* right understanding, 2 right or wrong thought\-conception *vitakka* 3 right speech *sammā* \- *[vācā](dic3_v.htm#vācā)* 4 right bodily action *sammā* \- [*kammanta*](dic3_k.htm#kammanta), 5 right livelihood *sammā* \- *ājīva* 6 right or wrong energy [*viriya*](dic3_v.htm#viriya) 7 right or wrong awareness or mindfulness [*sati*](dic3_s.htm#sati) 8 right or wrong concentration [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi) 9 wrong views *micchāditthi* 10 wrong speech *micchā* \- *[vācā](dic3_v.htm#vācā)* 11 wrong bodily action *micchā* \- [*kammanta*](dic3_k.htm#kammanta) 12 wrong livelihood *micchā* \- *ājīva* Cf. [*magga*](dic3_m.htm#magga)

19: Association\-condition [*sampayutta\-paccaya*](dic3_s.htm#sampayutta-paccaya) refers to the co\-nascent see: 6 and mutually see: 7 conditioned 4 mental groups [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) as they aid each other by their being associated, by having a common physical base, a common object, and by their arising and disappearing simultaneously; [Patth.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Patth.) [Com.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Com.).

20: Dissociation\-condition [*vippayutta\-paccaya*](dic3_v.htm#vippayutta-paccaya) refers to such phenomena as aid other phenomena by not baving the same physical base eye, etc. and objects. Thus material phenomena are for mental phenomena, and conversely, a condition by way of dissociation, whether co\-nascent or not.

21: Presence\-condition *atthi* \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) refers to a phenomenon \- being pre\-nascent or co\-nascent \- which through its presence is a condition for other phenomena. This condition applies to the conditions Nos. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11.

22: Absence\-condition [*natthi\-paccaya*](dic3_n.htm#natthi-paccaya) refers to consciousness, etc., which has just passed, and which thus forms the necessary condition for the immediately following stage of consciousness by giving it an opportunity to arise. Cf. No. 4.

23: Disappearance\-condition [*vigata\-paccaya*](dic3_v.htm#vigata-paccaya) is identical with No. 22.

24: Non\-disappearance\-condition [*avigata\-paccaya*](dic3_a.htm#avigata-paccaya) is identical with No. 21.

These 24 conditions should be known thoroughly for a detailed understanding of that famous formula of the dependent origination [*paticcasamuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda). Cf. [Fund.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Fund.) III, [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide) p. 117 ff. [App.](dic2-abbrev.htm#App.).

He comprehends the 4 Noble Truths individually *pacceka* independent of any teacher, by his own effort. He has, however, not the capacity to proclaim the Teaching effectively to others, and therefore does not become a 'Teacher of Gods and Men', a Perfect or Universal [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) *sammā* \- *sambuddha.* Paccekabuddhas are described as frugal of speech, cherishing solitude. According to tradition, they do not arise while the Teaching of a Perfect [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) is known; but for achieving their rank after many aeons of effort, they have to utter an aspiration before a Perfect Buddha.

The Bhikkhu rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, disadvantageous things not yet arisen… to overcome them… to develop advantageous things not yet arisen… to maintain them, and not to let them disappear, but to bring them to growth, to maturity and to the full perfection of development. And he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) IV, 13.

> 1;What now, o Bhikkhus, is the effort to avoid? Perceiving a form, or a sound, or an odour, or a taste, or a bodily or mental contact, the Bhikkhu neither adheres to the whole nor to its parts. And he strives to ward off that through which evil and disadvantageous things might arise, such as greed and sorrow, if he remained with unguarded senses; and he watches over his senses, restrains his senses. This is called the effort to avoid.

In [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) IV, 173, it is said:;As far as the field of sixfold sense\-contact extends, so far reaches the world of diffuseness or the phenomenal world; *papañcassa* [*gati*](dic3_g.htm#gati) as far as the world of diffuseness extends, so far extends the field of sixfold sense\-contact.

VIII, 30 has:,This Dhamma is for one who delights in non\-diffuseness the unworldly, Nibbāna; it is not for him who delights in worldliness [*papañca*](dic3_p.htm#papañca).

In the commentaries, we often find a threefold classification *tanhā\-, ditthi\-, māna\-papañca* which probably means the world’s diffuseness created hy craving, false views and conceit. \- See [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 123; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.)

IV, 173 and [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 18. \- The threefold classification of [*papañca*](dic3_p.htm#papañca) by way of craving, false views and conceit, is explained by the author as three aspects, or instances, of the foremost of delusive conceptualisations, the ego\-concept.

grammar = ""

```

**[]()Paramattha:** [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) \- *vacana* \- *[Desanā](dic3_d.htm#desanā)* 'truth or term, exposition that is true in the highest or ultimate sense', as contrasted with the 'conventional truth' *vohāra* \- [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) which is also called 'commonly accepted truth' [*sammuti\-sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sammuti-sacca) in Skr: *samvrti* \- *satya* The Buddha, in explaining his doctrine, sometimes used conventional language and sometimes the philosophical mode of expression which is in accordance whith unconfused insight into reality. In that ultimate sense, existence is a mere process of physical and mental phenomena within which, or beyond which, no real ego\-entity nor any abiding substance can ever be found. Thus, whenever the suttas speak of man, woman or person, or of the rebirth of a being, this must not be taken as being valid in the ultimate sense, but as a mere conventional mode of speech *vohāra* \- *vacana.*

It is one of the main characteristics of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, in distinction from most of the Sutta Pitaka, that it does not employ conventional language, but deals only with ultimates, or realities in the highest sense [*paramattha*](dic3_p.htm#paramattha) \- *dhammā* But also in the Sutta Pitaka there are many expositions in terms of ultimate language [*paramattha*](dic3_p.htm#paramattha) \- *[desanā](dic3_d.htm#desanā)* namely, wherever these texts deal with the groups [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) elements [*dhātu*](dic3_d.htm#dhātu) or sense\-sources [*āyatana*](dic3_a.htm#āyatana) and their components; and wherever the 3 characteristics *[tilakkhana](dic3_t.htm#ti-lakkhana)* are applied. The majority of Sutta texts, however, use the conventional language, as appropriate in a practical or ethical context, because it;would not be right to say that 'the groups' [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) feel shame, etc

It should be noted, however, that also statements of the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) couched in conventional language, are called 'truth' *vohāra* \- [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) being correct on their own level, which does not contradict the fact that such statements ultimately refer to impermanent and impersonal processes.

The two truths \- ultimate and conventional \- appear in that form only in the commentaries, but are implied in a sutta\-distinction of 'explicit or direct meaning' *nītattha* and 'implicit meaning to be inferred' *neyyattha* Further, the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) repeatedly mentioned his reservations when using conventional speech, e.g. in [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 9:,These are merely names, expressions, turns of speech, designations in common use in the world, which the Perfect Qne Tathāgata uses without misapprehending them.; See also [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) I. 25.

The term [*paramattha*](dic3_p.htm#paramattha) in the sense here used, occurs in the first para. of the Kathāvatthu, a work of the Abhidhamma Pitaka see: [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide), p. 62. App: vohāra.

The commentarial discussions on these truths [Com.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Com.) to [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 9 and [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 5 have not yet been translated in full. On these see K N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge London, 1963, pp. 361ff.

In Mahāyana, the Mādhyamika school has given a prominent place to the teaching of the two truths.

**[]()Paramī: []()Pāramitā:** 'perfection'. Ten qualities leading to Buddhahood: 1 perfection in giving or generosity; [*dāna*](dic3_d.htm#dāna) \- *pāramī* 2 morality [*sīla*](dic3_s.htm#sīla) \- *p* 3 renunciation [*nekkhamma*](dic3_n.htm#nekkhamma) \- *p* 4 understanding *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā)* \- *p* 5 energy *[viriya](dic3_v.htm#viriya)* \- *p* 6 patience or forbearance; [*khanti*](dic3_k.htm#khanti) 7 truthfulness [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) \- *p* 8 resolution *[adhitthāna](dic3_a.htm#adhitthāna)* \- *p* 9 loving\-kindness *[mettā](dic3_m.htm#mettā)* \- *p* 10 equanimity *[upekkhā](dic3_u.htm#upekkhā)* \- *p.* .

These qualities were developed and brought to maturity by the Bodhisatta in his past existences, and his way of practising them is illustrated in many of the Birth Stories Jātaka, of which, however, only the verses are regarded as canonical. Apart from the latter, the 10 *pāramī* are mentioned in only two other canonical works which are probably apocryphal, the Buddhavamsa in the Story of Sumedha and the Cariyapitaka. A long and methodical exposition of the *pāramī* is given in the concluding Miscellaneous Section *pakinnakakathā* of the [Com.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Com.) to Cariyapitaka

In [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) IX it is said that through developing the 4 sublime states loving\-kindness, Pity, altruistic joy, equanimity; see: [*brahma\-vihāra*](dic3_b.htm#brahma-vihāra) one may reach these 10 perfections, namely:

As the Great Beings *mahā* \- [*satta*](dic3_s.htm#satta) a synonym often found in the Mahāyana scriptures for Bodhisatta, i.e. 'Enlightenment Being or Being destined for Buddhahood are concerned about the welfare of living beings, not tolerating the suffering of beings, wishing long duration to the higher states of happiness of beings, and being impartial and just to all beings, therefore 1: They give food [*dāna*](dic3_d.htm#dāna) to all beings so that they may be happy, without Investigating whether they are worthy or not. 2: By avoiding to do them any harm, they observe morality [*sīla*](dic3_s.htm#sīla). 3: In order to bring morality to perfection, they train themselves in renunciation [*nekkhamma*](dic3_n.htm#nekkhamma) 4: In order to understand clearly what is beneficial and injurious to beings, they purify their understanding *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā)* 5: For the sake of the welfare and happiness of others they constantly exert their energy [*viriya*](dic3_v.htm#viriya) 6: Though having become heroes through utmost energy, they are nevertheless full of forbearance [*khanti*](dic3_k.htm#khanti) toward s the many failings of beings. 7: Once they have promised to give or do something, they do not break their promise 'truthfulness'; [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) 8: With unshakable resolution [*adhitthāna*](dic3_a.htm#adhitthāna) they work for the weal and welfare of beings. 9: With unshakable kindness *[mettā](dic3_m.htm#mettā)* they are helpful to all. 10: By reason of their equanimity *[upekkhā](dic3_u.htm#upekkhā)* they do not expect anything in return; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) IX. 24.

In the Mahāyana scriptures, where the *pāramī* occupy a much more prominent place, a partly differing list of six is given: generosity, morality, patience, energy, meditation. and understanding.

**[]()Paticcasamuppāda:** 'dependent origination', is the doctrine of the conditionality of all physical and psychical phenomena, a doctrine which, together with that of [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā), forms the indispensable condition for the real understanding and realization of the teaching of the Buddha. It shows the conditionality and dependent nature of that uninterrupted flux of many physical and psychical phenomena of existence conventionally called the ego, or man, or animal, etc.

Whereas the doctrine of [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā), or [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā) proceeds analytically, by splitting existence up into the ultimate constituent parts, into mere empty, unsubstantial phenomena or elements, the doctrine of dependent origination, on the other hand, proceeds synthetically, by showing that all these phenomena are, in some way or other, conditionally related with each other. In fact, the entire Abhidhamma Pitaka, as a whole, treats really of nothing but just these two doctrines: phenomenality \- implying [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) and conditionality of all existence. The former or analytical method is applied in Dhammasangani, the first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka; the latter or synthetical method, in Patthāna, the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. For a synopsis of these two works, see: [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide) I and VII.

Though this subject has been very frequently treated by Western authors, by far most of them have completely misunderstood the true meaning and purpose of the doctrine of dependent origination, and even the 12 terms themselves have often been rendered wrongly.

The formula of dependent origination runs as follows:

Before taking up the study of the following exposition, it is suggested that the reader first goes thoroughly through the article on the 24 conditions see: [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) For a thorough understanding of the [*paticcasamuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda) he should know the main modes of conditioning, as decisive support, co\-nascence, pre\-nascence, etc.

For a closer study of the subject should be consulted: [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII; [Fund.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Fund.) III; [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide) Ch. VII and Appendix; Dependent Origination, by Piyadassi Thera [WHEEL](dic2-abbrev.htm#WHEEL) [15](../Wheels/wh015.pdf); The Significance of Dependent Origination [WHEEL](dic2-abbrev.htm#WHEEL) [140](../Wheels/wh394.pdf).

1: []()Through ignorance are conditioned the kammic\-constructions; *avijjā\-paccayā sankhārā* i.e. all advantageous and disadvantageous actions kamma of body, speech and mind, are conditioned through ignorance. By 'kammic\-constructions' are meant kammically advantageous and disadvantageous intentions *[cetanā](dic3_c.htm#cetanā)* or intentional activities, in short kamma, and [Fund.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Fund.) II.

In view of the many misconceptions current in the West, it is necessary to repeat here that kamma, as a technical term, never signifies anything but moral or immoral action, i.e. the above mentioned intentional activities, or kammic\-constructions, as either causing results in the present life or being the causes of future destiny and rebirth. Thus kamma, as a philosophical term, never means the result of action, as often wrongly conceived by Western authors.

Now, in what way are the kammic\-constructions conditioned through ignorance? As concerns the disadvantageous kammaconstructions associated with greed, hate or confusion *lobha, dosa, moha* these are always and in all circumstances, conditioned through the simultaneous ignorance inseparably associated therewith. Thus, ignorance is for the disadvantageous kammic\-constructions a condition by way of conascence [*sahajāta\-paccaya*](dic3_s.htm#sahajāta-paccaya) association [*sampayutta\-paccaya*](dic3_s.htm#sampayutta-paccaya) presence *atthi* \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) etc. Ignorance further may be for them a condition by way of decisive support or inducement [*upanissaya\-paccaya*](dic3_u.htm#upanissaya-paccaya) if, for instance, ignorance coupled with greed induces a man to commit evil deeds, such as killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, etc. In these cases, therefore, ignorance is a 'natural decisive suppport' or 'direct inducement' *pakati* \- *upanissaya* \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) It also may become an indirect inducement, by way of object *ārammanūpanissaya* \- [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya) of our thinking. This takes place, if, for example, someone remembers a former state of ignorance combined with sensual enjoyment, and in doing so kammically disadvantageous states spring up, such as sensual desire, grief, etc.

For the advantageous [*kusala*](dic3_k.htm#kusala) kammic\-constructions, ignorance can only be a condition by way of decisive support *upanissaya* never by way of co\-nascence *sahajāta* etc., since advantageous consciousness at that very moment, of course, cannot be associated with any disadvantageous phenomenon, such as ignorance. Ignorance is a 'natural decisive support' or 'direct inducement' *pakatupanissaya* for example, if, induced by ignorance and vanity, one exerts oneself to attain the absorptions, and thus finally, through perseverance, reaches these advantageous states of mind. Ignorance may also be for advantageous kammic\-constructions a 'decisive support' or 'inducement by way of object' *ārammanūpanissaya* if, for example, one refleets on ignorance as the root of all [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) in the world, and thus finally attains insight and entrance into one of the 4 supra\-mundane [paths](dic3_m.htm#magga) of Nobility.

For ignorance, see: [*avijjā*](dic3_a.htm#avijjā) for kammic\-constructions, see: [*sankhāra*](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra).

2.;Through the kammic\-constructions is conditioned consciousness; *sankhāra\-paccayā viññānam* This proposition teaches that the advantageous and disadvantageous kammic\-constructions are the causes of future rebirth in an appropriate sphere [*gati*](dic3_g.htm#gati) The kammic\-constructions of the previous life condition the budding in a new mother’s womb of a fresh psycho\-physical aggregation of the 5 groups of existence see: [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) which here are represented by consciousness [*viññāna*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna) All such kamma\-resultant [*vipāka*](dic3_v.htm#vipāka) consciousness, however, such as visual\-consciousness seeing, etc., as well as all the mental phenomena associated therewith feeling, etc., are kammically neutral. It should be understood that already from the very first moment of conception in the mother’s womb, this kamma resultant eonsciousness of the embryonic being is functioning.

Against Dr. Paul Dahlke’s misconception of the [*paticcasamuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda) as;one single kammical moment of personal experience,; and of the 'simultaneity' of all the 12 links of this formula, I should like to state here distinctly that the interpretation of the **p.** given here as comprising 3 successive lives not only agrees with all the different schools of Buddhism and all the ancient commentaries, but also is fully identical with the explanations given already in the canonical suttas. Thus, for example, it is said verbatim in Nidāna\-Samyutta [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XII, 51:;Once ignorance 1 and clinging 9 are extinguished, neither kammically meritorious, nor disadvantageous, nor imperturbable kammic\-constructions 2=10 are produced, and thus no consciousness 3=11 will spring up again in a new mother’s womb.; And further:;For, if consciousness were not to appear in the mother’s womb, would in that case mentality and materiality 4 arise?; Cf. above diagram.

The purpose of the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) in teaching the **p.** was to show to suffering mankind how, depending on ignorance and confusion, this present existence and suffering has come about, and how through ceasing of ignorance, and of the craving and clinging conditioned thereby, no more rebirth will follow, and thus the standstill of the process of existence will have been realized and therewith the ceasing of all suffering.

3.;Through consciousness are conditioned materiality and mentality; *viññāna\-paccayā nāma\-rūpani* This proposition implies that without consciousness there ean be no mental and physical process of existence. By mentality *nāma* is here to be understood the kamma\-resultant [*vipāka*](dic3_v.htm#vipāka) mental phenomena, such as feeling [*vedanā*](dic3_v.htm#vedanā) perception *[saññā](dic3_s.htm#saññā)* intention *[cetanā](dic3_c.htm#cetanā)* non\-kammical intention is here meant, consciousness\-contact [*phassa*](dic3_p.htm#phassa) directing [*manasikāra*](dic3_m.htm#manasikāra) [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 9; [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XII, 2. For the basic 7 mental phenomena inseparably associated with every state of consciousness, see: *nāma* By materiality [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) is meant the 4 physical elements see: [*dhātu*](dic3_d.htm#dhātu) and the materiality dependent thereon see: [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) I.

Mentality is always conditioned through consciousness; i.e. consciousness [*viññāna*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna) is for mentality *nāma* a condition by way of conascence *sahajāta* mutuality *aññamañña* association *sampayutta* etc., since the 4 mental groups at all times form an inseparable unit.

Consciousness [*viññāna*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna) is for materiality [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) a condition by way of co\-nascence only at the moment of conception, thereafter a condition by way of post\-nascence [*pacchājāta\-paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#pacchājāta-paccaya) [paccaya](#paccaya) 11 and nutriment [*āhāra*](dic3_a.htm#āhāra) i.e. as a support. Just as the repeatedly arising hunger is a condition and support for the pre\-arisen body, so is the conseiousness arising afterwards a condition and support for the maintenance of this pre\-arisen body.

4.;Through mentality and materiality are conditioned the 6 bases *nāma\-rūpa paccayā salāyatanam* The 6 bases are a name for the 5 physical sense\-organs and, as 6th, the mind\-base manāyatana, i.e. consciousness.

Mentality *nāma* see: 3 is for the 5 physical bases [*āyatana*](dic3_a.htm#āyatana) or sense\-organs, a condition by way of post\-nascence. Cf. end of 3.

Mentality *nāma* i.e. feeling. etc., is for the 6th base, or consciousness \- as being always inseparably associated therewith a condition by way of co\-nascencc. etc.

Materiality [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) here the 4 elements, are for the 5 physical bases [*āyatana*](dic3_a.htm#āyatana) or sense\-organs, a condition by way of support [*nissaya*](dic3_n.htm#nissaya)

Materiality [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) here the 5 physical sense\-organs, are for the 6th base [*āyatana*](dic3_a.htm#āyatana), i.e. consciousness, a condition by way of support and pre\-nascence [*purejāta\-paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#purejāta-paccaya).

5.;Through the 6 bases is conditioned the sensorial and mental contact; [*salāyatana*](dic3_s.htm#salāyatana) \- *paccayā* *phasso* for without the 5 physical bases, or sense\-organs, there can be no sense\-contacts; and without the 6th base, or consciousness, there can be no mental contact.

Thus, the 5 physical bases, eye, etc., are for the corresponding 5 sense\-contacts visual contact, etc. a condition by way of support [*nissaya*](dic3_n.htm#nissaya) and pre\-nascence *purejāta* whereas the 6th, the mind\-base consciousness, is for the mental contact a condition by way of co\-nascence, association, mutuality, etc.

6.;Through contact is conditioned feeling; *phassa\-paccayā vedanā* i.e. the sensorial and the mental contacts are for the feeling associated therewith a condition by way of co\-nascence, association, mutuality, etc.

7.;Through feeling is conditioned craving; *[vedanā](dic3_v.htm#vedanā)* \- *paccayā* *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* Any kamma\-resultant feeling, whether pleasant, painful or neutral, bodily or mental, past or expected, may become for craving a condition of decisive support by way of object *ārammanūpanissaya* Even physically and mentally painful feeling may, through the desire to be released therefrom, become for craving a condition of decisive support by way of object *ārammanupanissaya.*

8.;Through craving is conditioned clinging; *tanhā\-paccayā upādānam* 'Clinging' is explained as an intensified form of craving. It is of 4 kinds: 1 clinging to sensuality, 2 to erroneous views, 3 to rules and ritual, 4 to personality\-belief. sense\-craving is to 1 a condition of natural decisive support *pakatupanissaya.* For 2\-4, craving is a condition by way of co\-nascence, mutuality, root [*hetu*](dic3_h.htm#hetu) etc. It also may be a condition of natural decisive support. For example, through craving for divine rebirth, etc. people often may be induced to cling to certain rules and rituals, with the hope of reaching thereby the object of their desires.

9.;Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming; *upādāna\-paccayā bhavo* i.e. the advantageous and disadvantageous active kamma\-making of becoming kamma\-bhava, as well as the kamma\-resultant [*vipāka*](dic3_v.htm#vipāka) passive process, the so\-called 'rebirth\-process' [*upapatti\-bhava*](dic3_u.htm#upapatti-bhava) The kamma\-making *kammabhava* comprises the 5 kammical causes: ignorance, kammic\-constructions, craving, clinging, kamma\-making see: 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, of the diagram; the rebirth\-process [*upapatti\-bhava*](dic3_u.htm#upapatti-bhava) comprises the 5 kamma\-results see: 3\-7 of the diagram.

The kamma\-making is here, correctly speaking, a collective name for generative kammic intention [*kamma*](dic3_k.htm#kamma) \- *[cetanā](dic3_c.htm#cetanā)* and all the mental phenomena associated therewith, whilst the 2nd link kammic\-constructions designates only kammic intention see: [*āyūhana*](dic3_a.htm#āyūhana) Both, however, i.e. the 2nd and 10th proposition, practically state one and the same thing, namely, that kamma is the cause of rebirth, as we shall see under 10.

Clinging [*upādāna*](dic3_u.htm#upādāna) may be an inducement of decisive support *upanissaya* to many kinds of advantageous and disadvantageous kamma. sense\-clinging *kāmūpādāna* i.e. clinging to sense\-objects, for example, may be a direct inducement to murder, theft, unlawful intercourse with the other sex, evil words and thoughts, etc. Clinging to rules and ritual *sīlabbatūpādāna* may lead to self\-complacency, fanaticism, cruelty, etc. Clinging is also for the evil kamma associated therewith, a condition by way of co\-nascence, association, etc.

10.;Through the process of becoming is conditioned rebirth; *bhava\-paccayā jāti* i.e. through the advantageous and disadvantageous kamma\-making [*kamma\-bhava*](dic3_k.htm#kamma-bhava) is conditioned the rebirth\-process [*upapatti\-bhava*](dic3_u.htm#upapatti-bhava) The 2nd and 10th propositions, as already pointed out, practically teach one and the same thing, namely, that kamma is the cause of rebirth; in other words, that the kammical intention *[cetanā](dic3_c.htm#cetanā)* is the seed out of which springs the new life, just as from the mango\-seed is generated the new mango\-tree.

Hence, the 5 kammical causes ignorance, etc. of the past birth are the condition for the kamma\-results of the present birth; and the 5 kammical causes of the present birth are the condition for the 5 kamma\-results of the next birth see: diagram. As it is said in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII:

>
>
>
>
> Five causes were there in the past,  
> Five fruits we find in present life;  
> Five causes do we now produce,  
> Five fruits we reap in future life
>
>
>
>

Now, just as in this process of continually changing mental and bodily phenomena, nothing can be found that would pass from one moment to the next moment, so also there is no enduring entity, ego, or personality, within this process of existence that would transmigrate from one life to the next see: [dic3\_n.htm#nāma\-rūpa](dic3_n.htm#nāma-rūpa) *[nāma\-rūpa](dic3_n.htm#nāma-rūpa),* [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā), [*patisandhi*](dic3_p.htm#patisandhi), [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) No being and no living soul passed from the former life to this life, and yet this present embryo could not have entered into existence without the preceding causes; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII.;Many things may serve to illustrate this fact, as for example the echo, the light of a lamp, the contact of a seal, or the image produced by a mirror; ib..

Whosoever is in the dark with regard to the conditionally arisen things, and does not understand that kamma originates from ignorance, etc., he thinks that it must be his ego that knows or does not know, acts and causes to act, and that arises at rebirth. Or he thinks that the atoms, or a creator, with the help of this embryonic process, must have formed this body, or that it is the ego endowed with abilities that has contacts, feels, desires, clings, continues and enters again into existence in a new birth. Or he thinks that all beings have been born through fate, or fortuitously; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII.

Now, on hearing that Buddhism teaches that everything whatever in the world is determined by conditions some might come to the conclusion that Buddhism teaches some sort of fatalism, and that man has no free will, or that will is not free.

The problem 'whether man has a free will' does not exist for, the Buddhist, since he knows that, apart from these everchanging mental and physical phenomena, no such entity as 'man' can be found, and that 'man' is merely a name not relating to any reality. And the question, 'whether will is free', must be rejected for the reason that 'will', or intention, is a mental phenomenon flashing forth only for a moment, and that as such it had not any existence at the preceding moment. For of a thing which is not, or is not yet, one cannot, properly speaking, ask whether it is free or unfree. The only admissible question would be whether the arising of 'will' is independent of conditions, or whether it is conditioned. But the same question would equally apply also to all the other mental phenomena, as well as to all physical phenomena, in other words: to everything and every occurrence whatever. And the answer would be: whether will arises, or whether feeling arises, or whether any other mental or any physical phenomenon arises, the arising of anything whatsoever is dependent on conditions, and without conditions nothing ever can arise or enter into existence.

According to Buddhism, everything mental or physical happens in accordance with laws and conditions; and if it were otherwise, chaos and blind chance would reign. But such a thing is impossible and contradicts all laws of thinking. Cf. [Fund.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Fund.) III end.

11.;Through rebirth are conditioned old age and death; *jātipaccayā jarā\-maranam* Without birth there can be no old age and death, no suffering and [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha). Thus rebirth is to old age and death, etc. a condition by way of decisive support *upanissaya.*

The [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) has said [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 15:;Profound, Ananda. is this dependent origination, and profound does it appear. It is through not understanding, not penetrating, this law that this world resembles a tangled ball of thread, a bird’s nest, a thicket of sedge or reed, and that man does not escape from the lower states of existence, from the course of woe and perdition, suffering from the round of rebirth.; And further [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 28: 'Whoso understands the dependent origination understands the Dhamma; and whoso understands the Dhamma understands the dependent origination.

1 *attha* Sanskrit *artha,* to reach; result, meaning, purpose, essence: designates, in short, the fruit [*phala*](dic3_p.htm#phala) of a cause [*hetu*](dic3_h.htm#hetu) for since the fruit of a cause results from adhering to the cause, and is reached and effected thereby, therefore it is called result *attha* In particular, however, 5 things are considered as *attha* namely: everything dependent on conditions, Nibbāna, the meaning of words, kamma\-result, and functional consciousness. When anyone reflects on that meaning any knowledge of his, falling within the category concerned with meaning or result, is the 'analytical knowledge' of meaning.

2 [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) Sanskrit *dharma* Ö *dhar* to bear; bearer, condition, law, phenomenon, thing is, in short, a name for condition [*paccaya*](dic3_p.htm#paccaya)… In particular, however, 5 things are considered as [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) namely: every cause [*hetu*](dic3_h.htm#hetu) producing a result, the noble [path](dic3_m.htm#magga), the spoken word, the kammically advantageous, the kammically disadvantageous. When anyone reflects on that law, any knowledge of his, falling within the category concerned with law or cause, is the 'analytical knowledge' of the law.

In [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.) it is further said: 'The knowledge of suffering is the 'analytical knowledge' of the true meaning [*attha\-patisambhidā*](dic3_a.htm#attha-patisambhidā) the knowledge of its origin is the 'analytical knowledge' of the law [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) \- *[patisambhidā](dic3_p.htm#patisambhidā)* The knowledge of the cause is the 'analytical knowledge' of the law [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) \- *[patisambhidā](dic3_p.htm#patisambhidā)* the knowledge of the result of the cause is the 'analytical knowledge' of the true meaning [*attha\-patisambhidā*](dic3_a.htm#attha-patisambhidā).. That the Bhikkhu knows the law, the sunas etc. this is called the 'analytical knowledge' of the law [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) \- *[patisambhidā](dic3_p.htm#patisambhidā)* if however, he understands the meaning of this or that speech… it is called the 'analytical knowledge' of the true meaning *attha\-patisambhidā.'*

3’The knowledge of the language concerning those things' means: the language corresponding to reality, and the unfailing mode of expression concerning the true meaning and the law.

4’Knowledge about the kinds of knowledges' is that knowledge which has all knowledges as object and considers them. Or, the analytical knowledge of ready wit *patibhāna* \- *[patisambhidā](dic3_p.htm#patisambhidā)* means the knowledge of the above mentioned 3 kinds of knowledge, in all their details, with their objects, functions, etc.; [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XIV.

```

**[]()Patisandhi:** lit. 'reunion, relinking', i.e. rebirth, is one of the 14 functions of consciousness [*viññāna\-kicca*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca). It is a kamma\-resultant type of consciousness and arises at the moment of conception i.e. with the forming of new life in the mother’s womb. Immediately afterwards it sinks into the subconscious stream of existence *[bhavanga\-sota](dic3_b.htm#bhavanga-sota),* and conditioned thereby ever and ever again corresponding states of subconsciousness arise. Thus it is really rebirth\-consciousness that determines the latent character of a person.

Neither has this rebirth\-consciousness transmigrated from the previous existence to this present existence, nor did it arise without such conditions, as kamma, kammic\-constructions, propensity, object, etc. That this consciousness has not come from the previous existence to this present existence, yet that it has come into existence by means of conditions included in the previous existence, such as kamma, etc., this fact may be illustrated by various things, such as the echo, the light of a lamp, the contact of a seal, or the image produced by a mirror. For just as the resounding of the echo is conditioned by a sound, etc., and nowhere a transmigration of sound has taken place, just so it is with this consciousness. Further it is said: 'In this continuous process, no sameness and no otherness can be found.' For if there were full identity between the different stages, then also milk never could turn into curd. And if there were a complete otherness, then curd could never come from milk. If in a continuity of existence any kamma\-result takes place, then this kamma\-result neither belongs to any other being, nor does it come from any other kamma, because absolute sameness and otherness are excluded here; Vis, XVII 164ff.

In [Mil.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Mil.) it is said:

Now, Venerable Nāgasena, the one who is reborn, is he the same as the one who has died, or is he another?

Neither the same, nor another; *na* *ca* *so* *na* *ca* *añño.*

Give me an example.

What do you think, o King: are you now, as a grown\-up person, the same that you had been as a little, young and tender babe?

No, Venerable Sir. Another person was the little, young and tender babe, but quite a different person am I now as a grown\-up man.;…

1. Is perhaps in the first watch of the night one lamp burning, another one in the middle watch, and again another one in the last watch?

No, Venerable Sir. The light during the whole night depends on one and the same lamp.''

Just so, o King, is the chain of phenomena linked together. One phenomenon arises, another vanishes, yet all are linked together, one after the other, without interruption. In this way one reaches the final state of consciousnes neither as the same person. nor as another person.''

According to the nature of their rebirth consciousness, beings divide into the following 3 groups:

>
>
>
>
> 1. [*ahetu\-patisandhika*](dic3_a.htm#ahetu-patisandhika) a 'being reborn without rootconditions', is a being whose consciousness at the moment of rebirth was not accompanied by any of the 3 noble rootconditions, viz. greedlessness, hatelessness, unconfusedness see: [*mūla*](dic3_m.htm#mūla) i.e. selflessness, kindness, intelligence. Such beings are found in the 4 lower worlds [*apāya*](dic3_a.htm#apāya),, in which case the function of rebirth is exercised by the class of consciousness listed in [Tab. I](table1.htm) as No. 56. But if such beings are born in the sense\-sphere as humans, they will be crippled, blind, deaf, mentally deficient, etc. Rebirth\-consciousness = [Tab. I](table1.htm), No. 41

In the suttas, the terms for rebirth are chiefly [*punabbhava*](dic3_p.htm#punabbhava), 'renewed existence', and [*abhinibbatti*](dic3_a.htm#abhinibbatti) 'arising'; or both combined as *punabbhavābhinibbatti* \- [App.](dic2-abbrev.htm#App.): *patisandhi.*

What, o Bhikkhus, is the power of reflection? If, o Bhikkhus, someone thinks thus: 'Bad conduct in deeds, words and thoughts verily bears bad fruits both in this life, as well as in the next life', and in consequence of this consideration, he abandons bad conduct in deeds, words and thoughts, follows good conduct, and keeps his mind pure, this, o Bhikkhus, is the power of reflection.

What, o Bhikkhus, is the power of mental development? If, o Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu develops the factors of enlightenment [*bojjhanga*](dic3_b.htm#bojjhanga), bent on solitude, on detachment, on ceasing, and ending in deliverance, namely: awareness or mindfulness, investigating of the law, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity, this, o Bhikkhus, is the power of mental development.

**[]()Patti\-dāna:** lit. 'giving of the acquired', i.e. 'transference of merit.' Though in the older texts very seldom mentioned e.g. A VII, 50, it is, however, a widespread custom in all Buddhist countries. It is presumed that moral merit, especially that acquired through giving food, can be transferred to others, apparently for the reason that one’s own good actions may become to others, especially to departed relatives and friends reborn in the ghost realm, an inducement to a happy and morally advantageous state of mind. Transference of merit is advocated though without mentioning the term [*patti\-dāna*](dic3_p.htm#patti-dāna) in the Tirokudda Sutta [Khp.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Khp.) and Petavatthu and its [Com.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Com.)

The specific Buddhist knowledge or understanding, however, as part of the Noble 8\-fold [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) [*magga*](dic3_m.htm#magga) to deliverance, is insight *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā),* i.e. that intuitive knowledge which brings about the 4 stages of Nobility and the realization of *[Nibbāna](dic3_n.htm#Nibbāna)* see: *[ariya\-puggala](dic3_a.htm#ariya-puggala)* and which consists in the penetration of the impermanency [*anicca*](dic3_a.htm#anicca), [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) [*dukkha*](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) see: [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca) and [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā) of all forms of existence.

With regard to the condition of its arising one distinguishes 3 kinds of knowledge knowledge based on thinking *cintā* \- *mayā* \- *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā)* knowledge based on learning *suta* \- *mayā* \- *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā)* knowledge based on mental development *[bhāvanā](dic3_b.htm#bhāvanā)* \- *mayā* \- *[paññā](dic3_p.htm#paññā)* [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 33.

'Based on thinking' is that knowledge which one has accquired through one’s own thinking, without having learnt it from others. 'Based on learning' is that knowledge which one has heard from others and thus acquired through learning. 'Based on mental development' is that knowledge which one has acquired through mental development in this or that way, and which has reached the stage of full concentration; *appanā* [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.)

Wisdom is one of the 5 mental abilities see: [*bala*](dic3_b.htm#bala) one of the 3 kinds of training *[sikkhā](dic3_s.htm#sikkhā),* and one of the perfections see: *pāramī* For further details, see: *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā)* and the detailed exposition in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.)

**[]()Phassa:** fr. *phusati* to touch: 'sense\-contact', contact. The term [*samphassa*](dic3_s.htm#samphassa) is used in compounds, e.g. in the following: ';T’here are 6 classes of sense\-contact: visual contact [*cakkhu*](dic3_c.htm#cakkhu) \- [*samphassa*](dic3_s.htm#samphassa) contacts of hearing, smelling, tasting, bodily tactile contact and mental contact; [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 9. A twofold division occurs in [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 15: [*patigha*](dic3_p.htm#patigha) [*samphassa*](dic3_s.htm#samphassa) contact by sensorial reaction', and *adhivacana* \- [*samphassa*](dic3_s.htm#samphassa) verbal or conceptual, i.e. mental contact'.

*[phassa](dic3_p.htm#phassa)* does not signify physical impact, but is one of the 7 constant mental properties of consciousness [*cetasika*](dic3_c.htm#cetasika) and belongs to the group of mental constructions [*sankhāra*](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra) \- *[khandha](dic3_k.htm#khandha)* In lists of both these categories it is generally mentioned first e.g. [Dhs.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Dhs.) 1: [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 9, due to its fundamental position in the cognitive process In [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 18 it is thus defined:;Dependent on the eye and the forms, visual\-consciousness arises; the coming\-together of the three is sense\-contact; similarly stated in the case of the other 5 senses, including mind. In the dependent origination, it is conditioned by the six sense\-sources and is a conditioning factor of feeling see: [*paticca* \- *samuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda), 6. Its relation to mind\-and\-body [dic3\_n.htm#nāma\-rūpa](dic3_n.htm#nāma-rūpa) *[nāma\-rūpa](dic3_n.htm#nāma-rūpa)* is described in [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 15, and its influence on feeling and wrong views, in [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 1 at the end. \- It is one of the 4 nutriments [*āhāra*](dic3_a.htm#āhāra), and the first factor in the pentad of sense\-contact [*phassa*](dic3_p.htm#phassa) \- *pañcamaka* together with feeling, perception, intention and consciousness see [Abh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Abh.) St., p. 47ff.

Being a key function in the mind’s contact with the world of objects and being a potential source of defilements, sense\-contact is an important subject for reflective insight contemplation as succinctly formulated in many verses of the [Sn.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Sn.): 736/7, 778, 851, 870/72, 923.

**[[progress of the disciple]]Progress of the disciple:** Gradual development of the 8\-fold [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) in the: In many suttas occurs an identical passage that outlines the gradual course of development in the progress of the disciple. There it is shown how this development takes place gradually, and in conformity with laws, from the very first hearing of the doctrine, and from germinating faith and dim comprehension, up to the final realization of deliverance.

After hearing the law, he is filled with confidence, and he thinks: 'Full of hindrances is household life, a refuse heap; but the homeless life of a Bhikkhu is like the open air. Not easy is it, when one lives at home, to fulfill in all points the rules of the Noble life. How if now I were to cut off hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from home to the homeless life?' And after a short time, having given up his possessions, great or little, having forsaken a circle of relations, small or large, he cuts off hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth from home to the homeless life.

Having thus left the world, he fulfills the rules of the Bhikkhus. He avoids the killing of living beings and abstains from it; without stick or sword, conscientious, full of sympathy, he is desirous of the welfare of all living beings. He avoids stealing… avoids unchastity… avoids lying… tale\-bearing… harsh language… vain talk.

He abstains from destroying vegetal germs and plants; eats only at one time of the day; keeps aloof from dance, song, music and the visiting of shows; rejects floral adornment, perfumes, ointment, as well as any other kind of adornment and embellishment. High and gorgeous beds he does not use. Gold and silver he does not accept… keeps aloof from buying and selling things.

He contents himself with the robe that protects his body, and with the food\-bowl with which he keeps himself alive. Wherever he goes, he is provided with these two things, just as a winged bird in flying carries its wings along with him.

By fulfilling this noble domain of morality [*sīla*](dic3_s.htm#sīla) he feels in his heart an irreproachable happiness.

In what follows thereafter it is shown how the disciple watches over his 5 senses and his mind, and by this noble restraint of the senses [*indriya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya) \- *samvara* feels in his heart an unblemished happiness; how in all his actions he is ever mindful and clearly conscious; and how, being equipped with this lofty morality [*sīla*](dic3_s.htm#sīla) and with this noble restraint of the senses [*indriya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya) \- *samvara* and with awareness or mindfulness and clear consciousness [*sati\-sampajañña*](dic3_s.htm#sati-sampajañña) he choses a secluded dwelling, and freeing his mind from the 5 hindrances [*nīvarana*](dic3_n.htm#nīvarana) he reaches full concentration [*samādhi*](dic3_s.htm#samādhi),, and how thereafter, by developing insight *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā)* with regard to the impermanency [*anicca*](dic3_a.htm#anicca) [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) [*dukkha*](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) and [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) [*anattā*](dic3_a.htm#anattā), of all phenomena of existence, he finally realizes deliverance from all fermentations and defilements, and thus the assurance arises in him:

**[]()Pīti:** rapture, enthusiasm rendered also by joy, happiness; interest it is one of the mental properties or properties [*cetasika*](dic3_c.htm#cetasika) and belongs to the group of mental constructions [*sankhāra*](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra) \- *[khandha](dic3_k.htm#khandha)* As, in sutta texts, it is often linked in a compound word. with 'gladness' *pāmojja* or 'happiness' [*sukha*](dic3_s.htm#sukha) some Western translations have wrongly taken it as a synonym of these two terms. Pīti, however, is not a feeling or a sensation, and hence does not belong to the feeling\-group *[vedanā](dic3_v.htm#vedanā)* \- *[khandha](dic3_k.htm#khandha),* but may be described psychologically as 'joyful interest'. As such it may be associated with advantageous as well as with disadvantageous and neutral states of consciousness.

A high degree of rapture is characteristic of certain stages in meditative concentration, in insight practice *[vipassanā](dic3_v.htm#vipassanā)* as well as in the first two absorptions [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna). In the latter it appears as one of the factors of absorption [*jhānanga*](dic3_j.htm#jhānanga) see: [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna) and is strongest in the 2nd absorption. Five degrees of intensity in meditative rapture are described in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) IV. 94ff. It is one of the factors of enlightenment [*bojjhanga*](dic3_b.htm#bojjhanga).

1: The Mahā\-mangala Sutta [Sn.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Sn.) 259 says that;Honour and respect towards those worthy of it, is conducive to great blessing; *pūjā ca pūjaniyesu etam mangalam uttamarn* See [Dhp.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Dhp.) 195f.

2: The [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) did not think much of mere outer worship.;Not thus, Ananda, is the Tathāgata respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped and honoured in the highest degree. But, Ananda, whatsoever Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni, lay man or lay woman, abides by the Teaching, lives uprightly in the Teaching, walks in the way of the Teaching, it is by him that the Tathāgata is respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped and honoured in the highest degree; [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 16. \-;There are two kinds of worship: in a material way *āmisa* \- *[pūjā](dic3_p.htm#pūjā)* and through practice of the Dhamma [*dhamma*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma) \- *[pūjā](dic3_p.htm#pūjā)* The worship through practice of the Dhamma is the better of the two; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.)

**[]()Tanhā:** lit. 'thirst': 'craving', is the chief root of suffering, and of the ever\-continuing cycle of rebirths.;What, o Bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering? It is that craving which gives rise to ever\-fresh rebirth and, bound up with pleasure and lust, now here, now there, finds ever fresh delight. It is the sensual craving [*kāma\-tanhā*](dic3_k.htm#kāma-tanhā) the craving for existence [*bhava\-tanhā*](dic3_b.htm#bhava-tanhā) the craving for non\-existence *vibhava* \- *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 22. **T.** is the 8th link in the formula of the dependent origination [*paticcasamuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda). Cf. [*sacca*](dic3_s.htm#sacca).

Corresponding to the 6 sense\-objects, there are 6 kinds of craving craving for visible objects, for sounds, odours, tastes, bodily contacts, mental contacts *rūpa\-, sadda\-, gandha\-, rasa\-, photthabba\-, dhamma\-tanhā* [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 9; [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 15

Corresponding to the 3\-fold existence, there are 3 kinds: craving for sensual existence [*kāma\-tanhā*](dic3_k.htm#kāma-tanhā) for fine\-material existence [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) \- *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* for immaterial existence *arūpa* \- *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 33

There are 18 'thought\-channels of craving' *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* \- *vicarita* induced internally, and 18 induced externally; and as occurring in past, present and future, they total 108; see [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) IV, 199; [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.), Ch. 17 Khuddakavatthu\-Vibhanga.

According to the dependent origination, craving is conditioned by feeling; on this see [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 22 section on the 2nd Truth.

Of craving for existence [*bhava\-tanhā*](dic3_b.htm#bhava-tanhā) it is said [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) X, 62:;No first beginning of the craving for existence can be perceived, o Bhikkhus, before which it was not and after which it came to be. But it can he perceived that craving for existence has its specific condition. I say, o Bhikkhus, that also craving for existence has its condition that feeds it *sāharam* and is not without it. And what is it? 'Ignorance', one has to reply.; \- Craving for existence and ignorance are called;the outstanding causes that lead to happy and unhappy destinies courses of existence; see: [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII, 36\-42.

The most frequent synonyms of *[tanhā](dic3_t.htm#tanhā)* are [*rāga*](dic3_r.htm#rāga) and [*lobha*](dic3_l.htm#lobha) see: [*mūla*](dic3_m.htm#mūla).

**[]()Tathāgata:** the 'Perfect One', lit. the one who has 'thus gone', or 'thus come', is an epithet of the [Buddha](../DPPN/b/buddha.htm) used by him when speaking of himself.

To the often asked questions, whether the Tathāgata still exists after death, or not, it is said e.g. [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XXII, 85, 86 that, in the highest sense [*paramattha*](dic3_p.htm#paramattha) the Tathāgata cannot, even at lifetime, be discovered, how much less after death, and that neither the 5 groups of existence [*khandha*](dic3_k.htm#khandha) are to be regarded as the Tathāgata, nor can the Tathāgata be found outside these material and mental phenomena. The meaning intended here is that there exist only these ever\-changing material and mental phenomena, arising and vanishing from moment to moment, but no separate entity, no personality.

When the commentaries in this connection explain Tathāgata by 'living being' [*satta*](dic3_s.htm#satta) they mean to say that here the questioners are using the merely conventional expression, Tathāgata, in the sense of a really existing entity.

Whether Perfect Ones appear in the world, or whether Perfect Ones do not appear in the world, it still remains a firm condition, an immutable fact and fixed law: that all constructions are impermanent, that all constructions are subject to suffering, that everything is without a self'' [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) III, 134.

What do you think, o Bhikkhus: Is materiality [*rūpa*](dic3_r.htm#rūpa) permanent or impermanent? \- Impermanent, o Venerable One. \- Are feeling [*vedanā*](dic3_v.htm#vedanā) perception *[saññā](dic3_s.htm#saññā)* mental constructions [*sankhāra*](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra) and consciousness [*viññāna*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna) permanent or impermanent? \- Impermanent, o Venerable One.

But that which is impermanent, is it something pleasant or painful? \- It is painful, o Venerable One.

But, of what is impermanent, painful and subject to change, could it be rightly said, 'This belongs to me, this am I, this is my ego'? \- No, Venerable One.

'I’herefore, whatever there is of materiality, feeling, perception, mental constructions and consciousness, whether past, present or future, one’s own or external, gross or subtle, lofty or low, far or near, of all these things one should understand, according to reality and true understanding: 'This does not belong to me, this am I not, this is not my ego' [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XXII, 59.

In one who understands eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and all the remaining constructions as impermanent, painful and no\-self, in him the mental chains [*samyojana*](dic3_s.htm#samyojana) are dissolved; [S.](dic2-abbrev.htm#S.) XXXV, 53.

It is the full comprehension of the 3 characteristics by direct meditative experience which constitutes liberating insight. About their relation to the three gateways ot liberation', see: [*vimokkha*](dic3_v.htm#vimokkha) I.

**[]()Titthāyatana:** the 3 'articles of heretical belief'. which in [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) III, 61 are declared as leading to inactivity, are: 1 the belief that all happiness and woe are produced through former kamma prenatal actions; see: kamma; 2 that everything is uncaused; 3 that everything is created by God.

1 is the teaching of Niggantha\-Nāthaputta, the leader of the Nigganthas, the modern Jains. The fault with this doctrine is that it does not account for that happiness and woe which either are the result of the present life’s good or bad action, or are associated with the corresponding action. 2 is the doctrine of Makkhali Gosāla; see: [*ditthi*](dic3_d.htm#ditthi)

According to the above 3 doctrines, man is not responsible for his actions, so that all moral exertions become useless.

It is also an object of kasina meditation. It is defined as follows: The space element has the characteristic of delimiting matter or form. Its function is to indicate the boundaries of matter. It is manifested as the confines and container of matter or form; or its manifestation consists in being untouched by the 4 great elements, and in holes and openings. Its proximate cause is the matter delimited. It is on account of the space element that one can say of material things delimited that 'this is above. below, around that' [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XIV, 63.

It is the object of the first formless absorption see: [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna), the sphere of Infinite space [*ākāsānañcāyatana*](dic3_a.htm#ākāsānañcāyatana). According to Abhidhamma philosophy, endless space has no objective reality being purely conceptual, which is indicated by the fact that it is not included in the triad of the advantageous *kusalatika,* which comprises the entire reality. Later Buddhist schools have regarded it as one of several unconditioned or uncreated states [*asankhata*](dic3_a.htm#asankhata) *dharma* \- a view that is rejected in [Kath.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Kath.) see: [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide). p. 70.

According to the Abhidhamma, this [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) \-moment of the *Stream\-enterer [sotāpanna](dic3_s.htm#sotāpanna)* & the other Nobles is generated by the insight into the [impermanence](dic3_a.htm#anicca), [misery](dic3_d.htm#dukkha) and [impersonality](dic3_a.htm#anattā) of all existence, reaching a certain threshold at that very moment and thus instantly transforming and ennobling the individual nature forever.

**[]()Ānāpāna\-sati:** Awareness or mindfulness on & by in\-and\-out\-breathing, is one of the most important trainings for reaching mental concentration and the 4 absorptions [*jhāna*](dic3_j.htm#jhāna). In the Satipatthāna Sutta [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 10, [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 22 and elsewhere, 4 methods of practice are given, which may also serve as basis for insight meditation. The speech on Awareness by Breathing' Ānāpānasati Sutta, [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 118 and other texts have 16 methods of practice, which divide into 4 groups of four. The first three apply to both calm [*samatha*](dic3_s.htm#samatha) and insight\-meditation, while the fourth refers to pure insight praxis only. With attentive mind he breathes in, with attentive mind he breathes out.

In M 118 it is further shown how these 16 exercises bring about the 4 foundations of awareness [*satipatthāna*](dic3_s.htm#satipatthāna), namely: 1\-4 contemplation of the body, 5\-8 contemplation of feeling, 9\-12 contemplation of mind, 13\-16 contemplation of mental states. Then it is shown how these 4 foundations of awareness or mindfulness bring about the 7 factors of enlightenment [*bojjhanga*](dic3_b.htm#bojjhanga), and then how these again produce release of mind [*ceto\-vimutti*](dic3_c.htm#ceto-vimutti) and release through understanding [*paññā\-vimutti*](dic3_p.htm#paññā-vimutti).

**[]()Āsava:** lit: fermentations, taints, corruptions, intoxicant biases. There is a list of four as in [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 16, [Pts.M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Pts.M.), [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.):  
1: The mental fermentation of sense\-desire [*kāmāsava*](dic3_k.htm#kāmāsava), Ex: 'All is pleasant'  
2: The mental fermentation of desiring existence [*bhavāsava*](dic3_b.htm#bhavāsava), Ex: 'Being is good'  
3: The mental fermentation of wrong views *ditthāsava,* Ex: 'My opinion is best'  
4: The mental fermentation of ignorance *avijjāsava.* Ex: 'Suffering exists not'  
A list of three, omitting the fermentation of views, is possibly older and is more frequent in the Suttas, e.g. in [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 2, [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 9, [D.](dic2-abbrev.htm#D.) 33; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) III, 59, 67; [A.](dic2-abbrev.htm#A.) VI, 63. In [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.) Khuddakavatthu [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.) both the 3\-fold and 4\-fold division are mentioned. The fourfold division also occurs under the name of floods [*ogha*](dic3_o.htm#ogha) and yokes [*yoga*](dic3_y.htm#yoga).

Through the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) of Stream\-Entry, the fermentation of views is destroyed;  
Through the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) of Non\-Returning, the fermentation of sense\-desire;  
Through the [path](dic3_m.htm#magga) of Arahatship, the fermentations of existence and ignorance.  
[M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 2 shows how to overcome the fermentations, namely, through insight, sense\-control, avoidance, wise use of the necessities of life. For a commentarial exposition, see [Atthasālini](dic2-abbrev.htm#Atthasālini) Tr. I, p. 63f: II, pp. 475ff.

*[khīnāsava](dic3_k.htm#khīnāsava)* = one whose fermentations are eliminated, or one who is fermentation\-free, is a name for the Arahat or Noble One. The state of Arahatship is frequently called [*āsavakkhaya*](dic3_a.htm#āsavakkhaya) the destruction of the fermentations. Suttas concluding with the attainment of Arahatship by the listeners, often end with the words: During this utterance, the minds of the Bhikkhus were freed from the mental fermentations through absence of clinging *anupādāya āsavehi cittāni vimuccimsū’ti.*

2: The 12 sources or bases on which depend the mental processes, consist of five physical sense\-organs and consciousness, being the six internal *ajjhattika* sources; and the six objects, the so\-called external *bāhira* sources \- namely:

>
>

> * eye, or visual organ and visible object  
>   
>   
>   
> * ear, or auditory organ and sound, or audible object  
>

By the visual organ *[cakkhāyatana](dic3_c.htm#cakkhāyatana)* is meant the sensitive part of the eye [*cakkhu*](dic3_c.htm#cakkhu) \- *pasāda* (retina) built up of the four elements… responding to sense\-stimuli *sa* \- *ppatigha.* [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.) II. Similar is the explanation of the four remaining physical sense\-organs.

The source\-of\-mind [*manāyatana*](dic3_m.htm#manāyatana) is a collective term for all consciousness whatsoever, and should therefore not be confounded with the mental\-element [*mano\-dhātu*](dic3_m.htm#mano-dhātu) see: [*dhātu*](dic3_d.htm#dhātu) II, 16, which latter performs only the functions of directing [*āvajjana*](dic3_a.htm#āvajjana) attention to the sense\-object, and of receiving *[sampaticchana](dic3_s.htm#sampaticchana-citta)* the data of the sense\-object. On the functions of the mind, see: [*viññāna\-kicca*](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca)

The visible object [*rūpāyatana*](dic3_r.htm#rūpāyatana) is described in [Vibh.](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vibh.) II as that phenomenon which is built up of the four primary elements and appears as color and form. What is seen by\-visual perception, i.e. by visual\-consciousness [*cakkhu\-viññāna*](dic3_c.htm#cakkhu-viññāna) are only colors and different intensities of light, but not three dimensional bodily things, which are interpretations.

The thinkable mental\-object\-source [*dhammāyatana*](dic3_d.htm#dhammāyatana) is identical with 'mental\-object\-element' [*dhamma\-dhātu*](dic3_d.htm#dhamma-dhātu), [*dhātu*](dic3_d.htm#dhātu) II\-17 and *dhammārammana* see: [*ārammana*](dic3_a.htm#ārammana). It may be physical or mental, past, present or future, real or imaginary.

The 5 physical sense\-organs are also called abilities [*indriya*](dic3_i.htm#indriya), and of these abilities it is said in [M.](dic2-abbrev.htm#M.) 43: Each of the five abilities owns a different domain, and none of them partakes of the domain of another one;… they have mind as their support… are conditioned by mental vitality (neural metabolic activity).

The 12 sense\-source are fully discussed in [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XV. In Yam III see: [Guide](dic2-abbrev.htm#Guide), p 98f. are  
the 12 terms are subjected to a logical investigation The six internal bases form the 5th link of dependent origination [*paticca* \- *samuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda) 5.

```

**[]()Āyūhana:** K ammic accumulation, is a name used in the commentarial literature for the advantageous and disadvantageous intentional activities kamma or kammic\-constructions [*sankhāra*](dic3_s.htm#sankhāra) (see: [*paticca* \- *samuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda) 2), being the causes of future rebirth. Accumulation, is a name for the past kammic\-constructions, and signifies those intentions *[cetanā](dic3_c.htm#cetanā),* which arised at the performance of a kamma, first while thinking 'I will give food', and then while actually giving the food or any other object. The intention, however, at the time when one is handing the food over to the recipient is called kamma\-making or kamma\-becoming *[kamma\-bhava](dic3_k.htm#kamma-bhava)* see. [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII, IX, X. Or, the intentions during the first six impulse\-moments [*javana*](dic3_j.htm#javana) depending on one and the same state of directing [*āvajjana*](dic3_a.htm#āvajjana) (see. *[viññāna\-kicca](dic3_v.htm#viññāna-kicca)* ), these are called the kammic\-constructions, whilst the 7th impulse moment is called the kamma\-making [*kamma\-bhava*](dic3_k.htm#kamma-bhava). Or, each moment of intention is called kamma\-making and the accumulation connected with it, kamma\-construction. [Vis.M](dic2-abbrev.htm#Vis.M.) XVII. Cf. [*paticca* \- *samuppāda*](dic3_p.htm#paticcasamuppāda) 2, 10 \- [App.](dic4_append.htm#āyūhana)
